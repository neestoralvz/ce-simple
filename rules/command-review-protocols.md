# Command Review Protocols - System Rule

**Updated**: 2025-07-26 | **Authority**: Command creation governance | **Scope**: All command development

## Command Review Rule

**MANDATORY before creating commands**: Rigorous review process to prevent duplication and ensure strategic value in command library.

## When to Apply This Rule

**IF command creation needed** → Any work involving:
- New command development
- Command modification or enhancement
- Command library expansion
- Workflow automation creation
- Slash command implementation

## 4-Phase Review Protocol: INVENTORY → ANALYZE → JUSTIFY → APPROVE

### Phase 1: INVENTORY
**Complete analysis of all 86+ existing commands for functional overlap**
- **Comprehensive scan** of export/commands/ directory structure
- **Functional mapping** of existing command capabilities
- **Workflow coverage analysis** across all 15 command categories
- **Gap identification** in current command library

### Phase 2: ANALYZE  
**Automated similarity detection + manual strategic necessity assessment**
- **Automated overlap detection** using command descriptions and functionality
- **Manual strategic analysis** of command purpose and user workflow integration
- **Duplicate prevention** through thorough capability comparison
- **Efficiency assessment** of proposed vs existing solutions

### Phase 3: JUSTIFY
**Demonstrate unique, irreplaceable value with clear user workflow gap**
- **Unique value proposition** that no existing command provides
- **Clear workflow gap** that creates user friction or inefficiency
- **Strategic necessity** for command library completeness
- **User benefit quantification** with measurable improvements

### Phase 4: APPROVE
**Pass ALL review gates before any command creation begins**
- **Technical review** for implementation feasibility
- **Strategic review** for library coherence and value
- **User experience review** for workflow integration
- **Final approval** from command governance authority

## Review Standards

### Overlap Prevention
- **Zero functional duplication** tolerance
- **Clear differentiation** from existing commands
- **Complementary functionality** that enhances rather than replaces
- **Strategic library expansion** vs library bloat

### Strategic Value Criteria
- **Measurable user benefit** (time savings, error reduction, etc.)
- **Workflow integration** that enhances existing command ecosystem
- **Technical excellence** meeting all VDD framework standards
- **Long-term maintenance** feasibility and value

### Quality Gates
- **Pre-Development**: Complete review process must pass
- **During Development**: Continuous validation against approved specifications
- **Post-Development**: Final validation before command deployment
- **Blocking Enforcement**: No command creation without full review approval

**Review Truth**: Rigorous command review prevents library bloat while ensuring every new command provides genuine strategic value to user workflows.
