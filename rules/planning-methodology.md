# Planning Methodology - System Rule

**Updated**: 2025-07-26 | **Authority**: System-wide methodology | **Scope**: All planning work

## Core Planning Protocol

**MANDATORY for complex projects requiring coordination**: Use systematic planning methodology with handoffs and parallel execution strategy.

## Planning Methodology Framework

### When to Apply This Rule
**IF planning work** → Complex projects with:
- Multiple implementation steps (>3 steps)
- Multiple thematic areas requiring different expertise
- Potential for parallel execution
- Need for handoffs between conversations/sessions
- Risk of content loss or coordination failure

### 4-Phase Planning Protocol

#### Phase 1: ANALYZE (Think×4 Analysis)
**Objective**: Deep understanding before planning

**Level 1 - Immediate Diagnosis**: Current state, immediate challenges, scope assessment
**Level 2 - Strategic Analysis**: Dependencies, risks, optimization opportunities, resource requirements
**Level 3 - Architectural Solution**: Overall approach, methodologies to apply, execution strategy
**Level 4 - Implementation Planning**: Step-by-step execution, coordination protocols, success criteria

#### Phase 2: DESIGN (Step-by-Step Plan)
**Objective**: Create comprehensive execution plan

1. **Break into logical phases** - Independent but coordinated work units
2. **Identify dependencies** - Sequential vs parallel opportunities  
3. **Define success criteria** - Measurable outcomes for each step
4. **Plan coordination** - How phases integrate and handoff
5. **Design safety nets** - Backup plans and rollback procedures

#### Phase 3: HANDOFF (Conversation Preparation)  
**Objective**: Enable independent execution by other agents

**Each handoff must contain:**
- **Complete context** - All background information needed
- **Specific objective** - Clear goal and success criteria
- **Methodology guidance** - Which rules/frameworks to apply
- **Task Tool strategy** - How to deploy sub-agents effectively
- **Integration points** - How this connects to other work
- **Safety protocols** - Content preservation and quality standards

#### Phase 4: COORDINATE (Multi-Conversation Strategy)
**Objective**: Optimize parallel vs sequential execution

**Execution Patterns:**
- **Fully Parallel**: Independent thematic areas (our docs/ audit example)
- **Sequential Waves**: Dependencies require staged execution
- **Mixed Strategy**: Some parallel, some sequential based on dependencies
- **Coordinated Integration**: Final conversation integrates all results

### Implementation Standards

#### Step-by-Step Plan Requirements
1. **Clear numbering** - Each step explicitly numbered and named
2. **Dependency mapping** - What must complete before this step
3. **Resource specification** - What information/tools needed
4. **Success criteria** - How to know step is complete
5. **Integration points** - How step connects to overall goal

#### Handoff Document Standards
1. **Executive summary** - What this conversation will accomplish
2. **Complete context** - All background information needed
3. **Specific tasks** - Step-by-step what to do
4. **Methodology references** - Which system rules to apply
5. **Success verification** - How to confirm completion
6. **Integration protocol** - How results connect to other work

#### Parallel Conversation Strategy
1. **Independence verification** - Confirm conversations can work independently
2. **Shared resources identification** - What needs coordination
3. **Integration planning** - How results will be combined
4. **Progress tracking** - How to monitor multiple conversations
5. **Conflict resolution** - How to handle overlapping or conflicting work

### Task Tool Integration

#### Sub-Agent Deployment in Planning
**Planning Agent Specialization:**
- Strategy development and resource planning
- Timeline generation and requirement analysis
- Multi-conversation coordination protocols
- Integration planning and verification procedures

**Task Tool Usage:**
- Deploy specialized planning agents for each thematic area
- Use parallel analysis for independent components
- Coordinate complex dependency mapping
- Generate comprehensive handoff documentation

### Quality Standards

#### Plan Validation Checklist
- [ ] All dependencies identified and mapped
- [ ] Parallel opportunities maximized
- [ ] Each step has clear success criteria
- [ ] Handoffs contain complete context
- [ ] Integration strategy is well-defined
- [ ] Safety nets and rollback procedures exist

#### Handoff Validation Checklist  
- [ ] Can be executed by new agent without additional context
- [ ] Contains specific task instructions
- [ ] References appropriate system rules
- [ ] Includes Task Tool deployment strategy
- [ ] Defines success verification
- [ ] Specifies integration requirements

### Success Metrics

**Planning Quality**: All components can be executed independently with clear integration
**Execution Efficiency**: Parallel work maximized, dependencies optimized
**Handoff Effectiveness**: New agents can execute without additional clarification
**Integration Success**: All parallel work combines into coherent final result

**Methodology Truth**: Systematic planning with handoffs and parallel execution transforms complex projects into coordinated, efficient, and successful implementations.
