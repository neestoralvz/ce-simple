# Architecture Decision Protocols

**Authority**: System methodology | **Purpose**: Systematic architectural decision-making with UltraThink×4 and PTS compliance

## When to Apply
**Architecture decisions** → System design, component architecture, integration planning, pattern selection, technical evaluation

## Decision Process Framework

### UltraThink×4 Cognitive Methodology
**Think**: Foundation analysis - core requirements, scope clarity, stakeholder identification
**Think Hard**: Deep analysis - pattern recognition, trade-off evaluation, dependency assessment, risk analysis  
**Think Harder**: Complex integration - multi-system coordination, cross-cutting concerns, evolution planning
**Ultra Think**: Solution synthesis - complete architecture design, implementation roadmap, validation strategy

### PTS Architectural Validation (12/12 Required)
**Technical Cluster**: Directness (≤3 layers), Precision (100% accuracy), Sufficiency (complete without over-engineering), Excellence (elegant simplicity)
**Communication Cluster**: Exactitude (exact integration points), Sobriety (zero unnecessary complexity), Structure (logical organization), Conciseness (≥80% value/complexity)
**Cognitive Cluster**: Clarity (≥90% comprehension), Coherence (zero internal conflicts), Effectiveness (≥95% objective achievement), Pragmatism (≥80% real usage)

### Decision Documentation
**Required Components**: Context/problem statement, alternative analysis, decision rationale, implementation plan, validation criteria
**Standards**: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), trade-off analysis, risk assessment, evolution planning

## Implementation Standards

### Cognitive Process Requirements
- Complete 4-layer UltraThink×4 application for complex decisions
- Systematic progression with quality gates between layers
- Documented reasoning at each cognitive layer

### Architectural Quality Gates
- 100% PTS compliance (all 12 components)
- Minimal viable architecture approach
- Pattern reuse and complexity reduction
- Clear component boundaries and responsibilities

### Documentation Requirements
- Comprehensive ADRs with rationale
- Systematic alternative evaluation
- Detailed implementation roadmap
- Integration with system architecture documentation

## Success Criteria
**Process**: Complete UltraThink×4 methodology application with documented progression
**Quality**: 100% PTS compliance, optimal simplicity/functionality balance
**Documentation**: Comprehensive ADRs with trade-off analysis and implementation plans
**Implementation**: Successful execution according to plan, measurable objective achievement
