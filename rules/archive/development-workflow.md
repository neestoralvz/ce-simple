# Development Workflow Standards (CONDITIONAL-MANDATORY)

**Authority**: Development process governance | **Purpose**: CONDITIONAL-MANDATORY development workflow enforcement
**TRIGGER**: Development tasks, coding operations, technical implementation | **Status**: Active | **Lines**: ≤80
**Updated**: 2025-07-27 17:00 (Mexico City)

## Enhanced Conditional Enforcement

**CONDITIONAL-MANDATORY**: When triggered, blocks progression until workflow compliance verified
**DOMAIN-UNIVERSAL**: Applies to ALL development operations when activated
**AUTO-EXECUTE-VALIDATION**: Automatic workflow checkpoint validation with blocking capability
**PROGRESSIVE-ESCALATION**: Workflow violations escalate from warning to blocking

## Master Development Workflow (MANDATORY)

### Phase 1: Initialization (MANDATORY)
**COMMIT INITIAL**: Create git commit before starting work to mark session beginning
**REQUEST ANALYSIS**: Apply Think×4 to user request interpretation and scope definition
**PTS Foundation**: Apply all 12 PTS components (Technical, Communication, Cognitive clusters) with blocking validation

### Phase 2: Discovery & Research (MANDATORY)
**EXPLORE CODEBASE**: Deploy Task Tools in parallel for relevant file discovery (8-16 concurrent searches)
**WEB RESEARCH**: Execute WebSearch for solutions, success cases, and industry best practices
**PATTERN ANALYSIS**: Identify existing patterns and architectural constraints with template consistency verification

### Phase 3: Analysis & Planning (MANDATORY)
**Think×4 APPLICATION**: Basic understanding → Deep analysis → Multi-system integration → Comprehensive synthesis
**STEP-BY-STEP PLANNING**: Create detailed implementation plan with specific phases and dependency mapping
**PLAN VALIDATION**: Apply Think×4 analysis to created plan for optimization and risk mitigation

### Phase 4: Implementation (MANDATORY)
**PARALLEL EXECUTION**: Deploy Task Tools with specialized sub-agents (5-10 concurrent operations)
**INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT**: Small testable increments with continuous PTS validation throughout
**PROGRESS TRANSPARENCY**: Individual agent reporting before result synthesis per transparency requirements

### Phase 5: Validation & Quality Assurance (MANDATORY)
**PTS COMPONENT VERIFICATION**: All 12 components validated before completion (BLOCKING requirement)
**TEST COVERAGE**: ≥90% test coverage verification required
**QUANTITATIVE VALIDATION**: Measure results against success metrics and performance targets
**STANDARDS VERIFICATION**: Complete development standards compliance check with integration testing

### Phase 6: Completion (MANDATORY)
**FINAL VALIDATION**: Confirm all success criteria met before completion
**COMMIT FINAL**: Create git commit marking session completion with work summary
**RESULT DELIVERY**: Present final results with complete transparency into process and contributions

## Development Quality Standards (BLOCKING)

### PTS Compliance Framework (ALL 12 COMPONENTS MANDATORY)
**Technical Cluster**: Directness ≤3 steps | Precision 100% | Sufficiency complete+minimal | Excellence impeccable
**Communication Cluster**: Exactitude | Sobriety | Structure | Conciseness with information density optimization
**Cognitive Cluster**: Clarity | Coherence | Effectiveness | Pragmatism with real-world validation

### TDD Integration (CONDITIONAL-MANDATORY)
**Test-First Development**: Write tests before implementation code
**Red-Green-Refactor**: Follow TDD cycle consistently
**Coverage Requirements**: ≥90% test coverage for all components
**Integration Testing**: Cross-module testing and validation

### Code Quality Standards (BLOCKING)
**Documentation**: Complete function and module documentation
**Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and validation
**Performance**: Meet established performance benchmarks
**Security**: Follow security best practices and validation

## Progressive Enforcement Protocol

### Workflow Validation Checkpoints
**Phase Completion**: Each phase requires validation before progression
**Quality Gates**: PTS compliance verified at each checkpoint
**Test Coverage**: Automated test coverage verification
**Integration Validation**: Cross-component compatibility testing

### Error Recovery Protocols
**Phase 1: CONDITIONAL-ADVISORY**: Workflow guidance and recommendations
**Phase 2: CONDITIONAL-REQUIRED**: Workflow compliance verification
**Phase 3: CONDITIONAL-MANDATORY**: Blocking until workflow standards met
**Phase 4: CONDITIONAL-BLOCKING**: Development halt for critical violations

## Success Criteria
**Workflow Completion**: All 6 phases executed with validation
**Quality Achievement**: 100% PTS compliance and ≥90% test coverage
**Integration Success**: Seamless system integration with existing architecture
**Documentation Complete**: Comprehensive documentation and handoff materials
