# Expert Panel Assembly Protocols (CONDITIONAL-MANDATORY)

**Authority**: Dynamic orchestration governance | **Purpose**: CONDITIONAL-MANDATORY expert coordination
**TRIGGER**: Multi-expert operations, parallel execution, complex domain coordination | **Status**: Active | **Lines**: ≤80

## Enhanced Conditional Enforcement

**CONDITIONAL-MANDATORY**: When triggered, blocks parallel execution until expert assembly compliance verified
**DOMAIN-UNIVERSAL**: Applies to ALL multi-expert operations when activated
**AUTO-EXECUTE-COORDINATION**: Automatic expert panel validation with blocking capability
**PROGRESSIVE-ESCALATION**: Coordination failures escalate from warning to system halt

## Expert Panel Assembly Framework

### Dynamic Expert Identification (CONDITIONAL-MANDATORY)
**TRIGGER**: Complex tasks requiring specialized knowledge coordination
**ENFORCEMENT**: Proper expert identification required before parallel deployment

**Core Question**: "¿Cuál es el grupo de expertos que mejor puede abordar este tema?"
**Assembly Process**:
- **Domain Analysis**: Identify required expertise areas for comprehensive coverage
- **Diversity Optimization**: Ensure complementary perspectives, eliminate redundancy
- **Synergy Configuration**: Configure experts for collaborative value and cross-pollination
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Deploy appropriate expert count based on complexity (no artificial limits)

### Expert Specialization Framework (CONDITIONAL-MANDATORY)
**TRIGGER**: Multi-expert coordination requirements
**ENFORCEMENT**: Clear specialization definition and domain expertise required

**Dynamic Expert Domains** (Examples, not exhaustive):
- **Technical Architecture Experts**: System design, performance, scalability, integration patterns
- **User Experience Experts**: Interface design, workflow optimization, accessibility, user psychology
- **Domain-Specific Experts**: Business logic, industry knowledge, regulatory compliance, specialized frameworks
- **Quality Assurance Experts**: Testing strategies, validation protocols, security assessment, reliability engineering
- **Strategic Vision Experts**: Product direction, competitive analysis, innovation opportunities, market alignment

## Execution Patterns (CONDITIONAL-MANDATORY)

### Expert Panel Deployment Requirements
**CONDITIONAL-MANDATORY**: All expert operations must satisfy coordination requirements

**Context Specialization**: Domain-specific background and requirements for each expert
**Expertise Definition**: Clear domain responsibilities and knowledge areas assigned
**Quality Integration**: Specific success criteria and collaborative deliverables defined
**Communication Protocol**: Individual reporting and expert coordination mechanisms
**User Transparency**: Real-time progress reporting and intervention capabilities

### Expert Coordination Protocol
**CONDITIONAL-BLOCKING**: Coordination failures halt expert deployment

**Collaborative Operations**: Related expertise grouped for synergistic execution
**Individual Expertise**: Each expert reports domain progress and results separately
**Synthesis Requirements**: Comprehensive integration of individual expert contributions
**Quality Validation**: Cross-expert verification and consistency checking

## Advanced Expert Assembly Patterns (CONDITIONAL-CRITICAL)

### Multi-Perspective Expert Analysis
**TRIGGER**: Complex analysis requiring diverse expert viewpoints
**ENFORCEMENT**: Complete expert perspective coverage mandatory

**Explore-Search-Synthesize-Analyze-Plan**: Comprehensive expert analysis workflow
**Individual Expert Transparency**: Each expert perspective reported individually
**Synthesis Integration**: Comprehensive integration of all expert viewpoints
**Decision Support**: Clear recommendations based on multi-expert analysis

### Dynamic Expert Coordination (CONDITIONAL-MANDATORY)
**TRIGGER**: High-complexity tasks with interdisciplinary requirements
**ENFORCEMENT**: Advanced expert coordination patterns required

**Expert Panel Assembly**: Research, Analysis, Implementation, Validation, Strategic experts
**Cross-Domain Integration**: System-wide expert perspective and coordination
**Performance Optimization**: Quality and efficiency measurement across expert domains
**Resource Utilization**: Optimal utilization of available expert capabilities

## Enforcement Protocol

### Expert Assembly Checkpoints
**CONDITIONAL-MANDATORY**: Each checkpoint must pass before progression

**Pre-Assembly**: Expert identification, domain definition, context specialization
**During Assembly**: Progress monitoring, quality validation, expert coordination
**Post-Assembly**: Result synthesis, quality verification, integration
**Final Validation**: Complete expert deliverable verification and acceptance

### Progressive Enforcement
**Phase 1: CONDITIONAL-ADVISORY**: Expert assembly guidance and optimization
**Phase 2: CONDITIONAL-REQUIRED**: Expert coordination compliance verification
**Phase 3: CONDITIONAL-MANDATORY**: Blocking until expert assembly requirements met
**Phase 4: CONDITIONAL-CRITICAL**: System halt for critical expert coordination failures

## Success Criteria

**Expert Coordination Efficiency**: Optimal expert utilization and minimal overhead
**Quality Integration**: Comprehensive synthesis of individual expert contributions
**User Transparency**: Clear visibility into expert assembly execution progress
**Result Quality**: Enhanced outcomes through effective expert coordination
