## Core System Frameworks (SINGLE AUTHORITY)

### PTS Validation Framework (12 COMPONENTS MANDATORY)
**Technical Cluster**: Directness ≤3 steps | Precision 100% accuracy | Sufficiency complete+minimal | Excellence impeccable quality
**Communication Cluster**: Exactitude implementation | Sobriety 0% marketing | Structure logical organization | Conciseness ≥80% density
**Cognitive Cluster**: Clarity ≥90% comprehension | Coherence 0% conflicts | Effectiveness ≥95% completion | Pragmatism ≥80% usage
**Application**: Universal validation requirement across ALL quality-critical operations and implementations

### Think×4 Methodology (MANDATORY COGNITIVE FRAMEWORK)
**Basic Layer**: Immediate observations and understanding documentation
**Deep Layer**: Complexity analysis and implications assessment  
**Integration Layer**: Multi-system integration and long-term consequences analysis
**Synthesis Layer**: Comprehensive solution architecture determination
**Application**: Required for ALL complex operations, architectural decisions, and significant implementations

### Responsive Architecture Validation Framework (5 COMPONENTS MANDATORY)
**Mathematical Analysis**: Structural logic verification | Consistency modeling | Performance prediction
**Qualitative Evaluation**: Conceptual coherence assessment | User experience validation | Design alignment verification
**Quantitative Measurement**: Performance metrics collection | Efficiency tracking | Success rate measurement
**Code Testing**: Functionality verification | Reliability testing | Integration validation
**Result Visualization**: Outcome demonstration | Comprehension verification | Impact visualization
**Authority**: user-input/PRINCIPLES.md Responsive Architecture Principle

### Line Limits Standards (CONTEXT ECONOMY)
**Commands**: ≤80 lines maximum with self-contained logic and single responsibility
**Documents**: ≤100-150 lines context-optimized with progressive disclosure patterns
**Rules**: ≤80 lines maximum with focused responsibility and clear boundaries

### Quality Gates Framework (BLOCKING ENFORCEMENT)
**Blocking Criteria**: Standards preventing progression until compliance achieved
**Validation Requirements**: Systematic quality verification with measurable criteria
**Success Metrics**: Quantitative and qualitative assessment standards

### Agent Deployment Standards (TASK TOOL INTEGRATION)
**Implementation Agent**: Deploy Task Tool for methodology application
**Validation Agent**: Deploy Task Tool for implementation audit
**Specialized Agents**: Context-specific deployment with clear mission boundaries
