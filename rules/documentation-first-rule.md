# Documentation First Rule - System Rule

**Updated**: 2025-07-26 | **Authority**: System methodology | **Scope**: All file creation

## Core Documentation First Protocol

**MANDATORY before creating files**: Analyze complete documentation structure before any file creation to ensure optimal placement and system coherence.

## When to Apply This Rule

**IF file creation needed** â†’ Any work involving:
- Creating new documentation files
- Adding content to existing systems
- Reorganizing or restructuring content
- Planning new system components
- Expanding existing frameworks

## 4-Step Documentation First Protocol

### Step 1: ANALYZE (Complete Structure Assessment)
**Objective**: Understand entire system before adding to it

**Process:**
1. **Examine complete structure** - All existing directories and their purposes
2. **Understand organizational logic** - How current system is organized
3. **Identify patterns** - Consistent organizational principles
4. **Assess gaps** - Where current structure may be incomplete
5. **Evaluate impact** - How new content affects overall organization

**Questions to Answer:**
- What is the purpose of each existing directory?
- What organizational logic governs the current structure?
- How does new content fit into existing patterns?
- What are the navigation implications?

### Step 2: DECIDE (Optimal Location Selection)
**Objective**: Choose best location based on comprehensive analysis

**Process:**
1. **Evaluate placement options** - Multiple potential locations
2. **Apply consistency criteria** - Match existing organizational logic
3. **Consider navigation impact** - User discovery and system clarity
4. **Assess future scalability** - How choice affects system growth
5. **Choose optimal location** - Best serves overall system coherence

**Decision Criteria:**
- Consistency with existing organizational logic
- Optimal user experience and navigation
- Thematic coherence and logical grouping
- Future scalability and maintainability
- System-wide clarity and discoverability

### Step 3: DOCUMENT (Architectural Decision Record)
**Objective**: Record decision process and establish precedent

**Process:**
1. **Create decision document** - Clear record of choice and reasoning
2. **Document analysis process** - What was considered and why
3. **Record alternatives** - Options considered and why rejected
4. **Establish precedent** - Guide for similar future decisions
5. **Ensure transparency** - Clear justification for organizational choices

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Clear justification for location choice
- Analysis process and alternatives considered  
- Precedent establishment for future decisions
- Integration with overall system vision
- Decision rationale for future reference

### Step 4: CREATE (Implementation After Planning)
**Objective**: Implement files only after thorough planning

**Process:**
1. **Create in decided location** - Follow documented decision
2. **Apply naming conventions** - Consistent with system patterns
3. **Maintain integration** - Proper cross-references and navigation
4. **Verify system coherence** - Confirm integration with existing structure
5. **Update navigation** - Ensure discoverability and proper references

**Implementation Standards:**
- Follow established naming conventions
- Maintain consistency with documented decision
- Integrate properly with existing cross-reference system
- Verify navigation and discoverability
- Confirm system coherence maintained

## Quality Standards

### Analysis Depth Requirements
**Complete understanding required:**
- All directory structures and purposes examined
- Organizational patterns and principles understood
- Impact assessment on overall system navigation
- Future scalability considerations evaluated

### Decision Quality Criteria
**Optimal placement standards:**
- Consistency with existing organizational logic
- Enhanced rather than complicated system navigation
- Thematic coherence maintained or improved
- Future system growth accommodated
- Clear justification and reasoning documented

### Documentation Standards
**Decision record requirements:**
- Clear placement reasoning and process
- Alternatives considered and rejection rationale
- Precedent establishment for similar decisions
- Integration with overall system vision
- Transparency in organizational choices

## Success Criteria

### Structural Consistency
**Integration standards:**
- New files integrate seamlessly with existing organization
- Navigation patterns enhanced rather than complicated
- System coherence maintained or improved
- User experience optimized

### Decision Quality
**Process standards:**
- Comprehensive analysis conducted before creation
- Optimal location chosen based on clear criteria
- Decision process documented for future reference
- Precedent established for similar situations

### System Integrity
**Coherence standards:**
- Overall documentation architecture maintained
- Navigation clarity preserved or enhanced
- Organizational logic consistently applied
- Future scalability considerations addressed

**Documentation First Truth**: Comprehensive analysis and documented decision-making before file creation ensures optimal system organization and long-term coherence.
