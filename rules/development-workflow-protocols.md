# Development Workflow Protocols

**Authority**: System methodology | **Purpose**: Comprehensive development standards ensuring systematic implementation with PTS compliance and quality gates

## When to Apply
**Development work** → Code implementation/modification, system architecture changes, feature development, technical problem solving, component creation/integration

## Development Workflow Framework

### Foundation Requirements
**Before development work begins**:
1. **PTS Framework Application**: Apply all 12 components (blocking requirement) - Technical, Communication, Cognitive clusters with complete validation
2. **Essential Pattern Implementation**: Follow established templates/patterns, maintain architecture consistency, apply proven structural approaches  
3. **Core Development Standards**: Technical implementation requirements, code quality/consistency, integration/compatibility protocols

### Development Process Steps

**Step 1: Foundation Analysis**
- PTS Validation (all 12 components before design)
- Pattern Assessment (identify applicable templates/patterns)
- Standards Review (confirm development standards compliance)
- Architecture Alignment (verify system architecture consistency)

**Step 2: Design Phase**
- UltraThink×4 Application (progressive analysis for complex development)
- Component Design (modular design principles)
- Integration Planning (system-wide impact/dependencies consideration)
- Quality Gate Definition (establish validation criteria)

**Step 3: Implementation Phase**
- Incremental Development (small, testable increments)
- Continuous PTS Validation (ongoing compliance verification)
- Pattern Consistency (maintain template alignment)
- Standard Compliance (regular development standards checks)

**Step 4: Validation Phase**
- PTS Component Verification (all 12 components validated)
- Pattern Compliance Check (template/structural consistency)
- Standards Verification (complete development standards compliance)
- Integration Testing (system-wide compatibility/functionality)

## Quality Standards

### PTS Compliance Requirements
**All development must pass 12/12 PTS components**:
**Technical Cluster**: Directness, Precision, Sufficiency, Excellence
**Communication Cluster**: Exactitude, Sobriety, Structure, Conciseness
**Cognitive Cluster**: Clarity, Coherence, Effectiveness, Pragmatism

### Pattern Consistency Standards
- Follow established command/component templates
- Maintain consistency with existing architectural patterns
- Apply proven structural approaches from template library
- Ensure reusability and maintainability

### Development Standards Compliance
- Code quality and style consistency
- Documentation and commenting standards
- Testing and validation requirements
- Integration and compatibility protocols

## Success Criteria
**Development Quality**: 100% PTS compliance (all 12 components), complete pattern consistency, full standards compliance, comprehensive integration verification
**System Integration**: Seamless existing architecture integration, maintained system coherence, proper modular design, optimal performance/reliability
**Documentation**: Updated documentation for changes, accurate cross-references, proper system integration, maintained discoverability/clarity
