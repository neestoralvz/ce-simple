# Master Workflow Protocols

**Authority**: System methodology | **Purpose**: Complete workflow for ALL user requests from initial commit to final delivery

## When to Apply
**IF user request received** ‚Üí All user requests, tasks, questions, and work assignments regardless of complexity

## Master Workflow Framework

### Phase 1: Initialization
**COMMIT INITIAL**: Create git commit before starting work to mark session beginning
**REQUEST ANALYSIS**: Apply Think√ó4 to user request interpretation and scope definition

### Phase 2: Discovery & Research
**EXPLORE CODEBASE**: Deploy Task Tools in parallel for relevant file discovery (8-16 concurrent searches)
**WEB RESEARCH**: Execute WebSearch for solutions, success cases, and industry best practices
**PATTERN ANALYSIS**: Identify existing patterns and architectural constraints in current system

### Phase 3: Analysis & Planning
**COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS**: Apply Think√ó4 methodology to all gathered information
- Think: Basic understanding of problem and resources
- Think Hard: Deep analysis of complexity and implications
- Think Harder: Multi-system integration and long-term consequences  
- Ultra Think: Comprehensive synthesis with optimal solution architecture

**STEP-BY-STEP PLANNING**: Create detailed implementation plan with specific phases
**PLAN VALIDATION**: Apply Think√ó4 analysis to the created plan for optimization

### Phase 4: Implementation
**PARALLEL EXECUTION**: Deploy Task Tools with specialized sub-agents (5-10 concurrent operations)
**CONCURRENT PROCESSING**: Simultaneous file operations, analysis, and system modifications
**PROGRESS TRANSPARENCY**: Individual agent reporting before result synthesis per transparency requirements

### Phase 5: Validation & Quality Assurance
**QUANTITATIVE VALIDATION**: Measure results against success metrics and performance targets
**QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT**: Evaluate solution quality, maintainability, and user requirements fulfillment
**IMPROVEMENT LOOP**: Execute up to 5 iterations if success criteria not met

### Phase 6: Completion
**FINAL VALIDATION**: Confirm all success criteria met before completion
**COMMIT FINAL**: Create git commit marking session completion with work summary
**RESULT DELIVERY**: Present final results with transparency into process and sub-agent contributions

## Success Criteria
**Process Completion**: All 6 phases executed without skipping steps
**Think√ó4 Application**: Mandatory cognitive methodology applied in Phases 3 and planning validation
**Parallel Execution**: Maximum use of Task Tools and concurrent processing
**Quality Gates**: Quantitative and qualitative validation with improvement loops if needed
**Git Tracking**: Initial and final commits for session bookkeeping
