# Orchestration Protocols - System Rule

**Updated**: 2025-07-26 | **Authority**: System operation | **Scope**: All Task Tool usage

## Core Orchestration Protocol

**MANDATORY for all agent deployment**: Execute Task Tools as priority with parallel execution in single messages, coordinating multiple agents for complex operations.

## When to Apply This Rule

**IF orchestration needed** â†’ Any work involving:
- Multiple tool usage in single operation
- Complex operations requiring coordination
- Parallel execution opportunities
- Sub-agent deployment for specialized tasks
- Multi-step workflows requiring efficiency

## Primary Orchestrator Protocol

### Orchestration Priority
**Task Tool as Primary Execution Method:**
- Deploy Task Tools as priority for all complex operations
- Execute all tools in parallel/simultaneous/concurrent mode within single messages
- Coordinate multiple agents for complex operations
- Maximize execution efficiency through batched tool calls
- Never use sequential execution when parallel is possible

### Agent Specialization Standards
**When deploying agents via Task Tools:**
1. **Provide clear specialization area** - Specific domain or function
2. **Define specific objective** - Clear goal and expected outcome
3. **Supply sufficient context** - All background needed for success
4. **Include relevant files/sources** - Specific resources to use
5. **Give complete background** - Full understanding for autonomous operation

## Parallel Execution Standards

### Batched Tool Calls
**Single message with multiple tool uses:**
- Batch all parallel operations in one message
- Coordinate independent tasks simultaneously
- Maximize efficiency through concurrent execution
- Reduce overall execution time
- Optimize resource utilization

### Concurrent Operations
**Parallel execution patterns:**
- Analysis tasks: 4-8 parallel agents
- Search operations: 8-16 parallel agents  
- File operations: 5-10 parallel agents
- Validation: Distributed parallel testing
- Implementation: Coordinated parallel development

### Agent Coordination
**Multi-agent deployment standards:**
- Clear role definition for each agent
- Specific tool allocation per agent
- Coordination protocols between agents
- Result synthesis and integration
- Quality verification across all agents

## Agent Specialization Framework

### Specialized Agent Types
**Discovery Agent Specialization:**
- Code analysis and file exploration
- Pattern detection and codebase mapping
- Technology stack identification
- Architecture analysis and documentation assessment

**Planning Agent Specialization:**
- Strategy development and resource planning
- Timeline generation and requirement analysis
- Multi-conversation coordination protocols
- Integration planning and verification procedures

**Execution Agent Specialization:**
- Implementation and file modification
- Parallel execution and code generation
- Build processes and deployment coordination
- System integration and configuration

**Validation Agent Specialization:**
- Quality assurance and testing coordination
- Compliance checking and PTS validation
- Error detection and correction procedures
- Performance verification and optimization

### Agent Deployment Strategy
**Task allocation principles:**
- Match agent specialization to task requirements
- Provide complete context for autonomous operation
- Define clear success criteria and deliverables
- Establish coordination protocols with other agents
- Enable parallel execution where possible

## Transparency Requirements

### Sub-Agent Visibility Protocol
**Individual Agent Reporting:**
- Each agent reports results directly to user
- Progress updates provided in real-time
- Clear attribution of work to specific agents
- Individual agent success/failure status
- Comprehensive result synthesis after individual reports

### User Communication Standards
**Transparency guarantee:**
- User sees individual results from each agent
- Clear explanation of agent deployment strategy
- Progress indication during parallel execution
- Result attribution to specific agents
- Final synthesis combines all individual outputs

## Performance Optimization

### Execution Efficiency
**Parallel processing optimization:**
- Maximize concurrent operations
- Minimize sequential dependencies
- Optimize resource allocation across agents
- Reduce overall execution time
- Enhance system throughput

### Coordination Efficiency
**Multi-agent coordination:**
- Clear communication protocols between agents
- Efficient result sharing and integration
- Minimized coordination overhead
- Optimized workflow patterns
- Effective conflict resolution

### Resource Management
**System resource optimization:**
- Balanced load across available agents
- Efficient tool utilization patterns
- Optimized memory and processing usage
- Effective parallel execution scheduling
- Resource conflict resolution

## Quality Standards

### Agent Performance Validation
**Quality assurance for agent work:**
- Each agent meets specific success criteria
- Individual agent output validated
- Integration verification across all agents
- Overall system coherence maintained
- User requirements fully satisfied

### Coordination Validation
**Multi-agent coordination assessment:**
- Effective communication between agents
- Successful result integration
- Optimal resource utilization
- Efficient workflow execution
- Quality output delivery

### System Reliability
**Orchestration system validation:**
- Consistent parallel execution capability
- Reliable agent deployment and coordination
- Effective error handling and recovery
- Maintained system performance
- User experience optimization
