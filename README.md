### Rules System Architecture
**Perpetual vs Conditional Loading**:
- **Perpetual Rules**: Always-active behavioral protocols loaded via `@rules/perpetual/conditional-loading.md`
- **Conditional Rules**: Context-specific standards triggered by `IF [context] → READ [rule]` patterns  
- **Naming Convention**: `[category]-[function]-[perpetual|conditional].md` for consistent organization

**Categories**:
- **authority-**: User hierarchy, sacred spaces, vision validation
- **enforcement-**: Compliance, blocking requirements, Think×4 methodology  
- **communication-**: Language standards, directive patterns, transparency
- **orchestration-**: Workflow coordination, sub-agent management, parallel execution
- **quality-**: Performance monitoring, feedback collection, validation gates
- **standards-**: Technical specifications, writing requirements (conditional only)
- **protocols-**: Step-by-step workflows, domain processes (conditional only)
- **methodology-**: Analysis approaches, development methodologies (conditional only)
- **governance-**: Decision-making, review processes (conditional only)
- **implementation-**: Technical implementation details (conditional only)

### Documentation Architecture
- **Foundation Layer** (≤80 lines): Essential concepts as agent prompts
- **Implementation Layer** (≤100 lines): Detailed procedures for deployment
- **Validation Layer** (≤100 lines): Quality gates and compliance checking

### Authority Hierarchy
1. **docs/vision/** - System direction (absolute authority)
2. **rules/CLAUDE_RULES.md** - Partnership protocol and decision trees
3. **docs/core/** - Technical implementation frameworks
4. **CLAUDE.md** - Navigation hub (≤80 lines with conditional loading)
