## Usage Instructions

### For Project Integration
1. **Deploy Global Commands**: Copy export/commands/ to your global Claude Code directory
2. **Reference Commands**: Use slash command syntax (e.g., `/start`, `/validate-code`)
3. **Maintain Boundaries**: Global commands cannot access project-specific files
4. **Orchestrate Workflows**: Combine simple commands for complex workflows

### Command Architecture
- **Self-Contained**: Each command includes all necessary logic and patterns
- **Single Responsibility**: Each command does exactly one thing well
- **Orchestration Ready**: Commands can call other commands via slash syntax
- **Boundary Enforcement**: Commands cannot reference external files or directories

### Development Standards
- **Maximum Length**: 150 lines per command (LLM optimization)
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting with clear purpose and usage
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and user guidance
- **Quality Compliance**: All commands meet STP 12-component framework

## Integration Guidelines

### Project-Specific Commands
- **Local Commands**: Projects can create local commands in their commands/ directory
- **Global Access**: Local commands can call global commands via slash syntax
- **No Modification**: Projects cannot modify global commands
- **Clean Separation**: Clear boundary between global and local functionality

### Workflow Patterns
- **Discovery ’ Planning ’ Execution ’ Validation**: Standard workflow progression
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple commands can run simultaneously via orchestration
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in fallback strategies and user guidance
- **Learning Integration**: Commands capture patterns for continuous improvement

### Quality Standards
- **STP Compliance**: All commands validated against 12-component framework
