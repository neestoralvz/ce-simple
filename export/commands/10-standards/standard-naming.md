# /standard-naming - Naming Conventions System

## Purpose
Establishes standardized naming conventions ensuring system-wide consistency through verbo-sustantivo patterns, type-based organization, and validation enforcement protocols.

## Principles and Guidelines
- **Verbo-Sustantivo Pattern**: Apply verb-noun structure for commands and functions ensuring clarity
- **Type-Based Consistency**: Maintain consistent naming within categories using appropriate conventions
- **Systematic Organization**: Use numbered directories for ordering, descriptive names for content grouping
- **Validation Enforcement**: Apply naming validation across commands, files, directories, and variables

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Command & File Naming Standards
Update TodoWrite mark "naming standards establishment" as in_progress

Apply verbo-sustantivo pattern using systematic validation:
- Implement /verb-noun pattern for all slash commands
- Apply lowercase-hyphenated naming for documentation files
- Use topic-type.md format for documentation organization
- Enforce template-purpose.md pattern for template files

### Phase 2: Directory & Variable Standards
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "directory variable standards" as in_progress

Establish organizational naming using structural validation:
- Apply ##-category/ numbering for ordered directory structure
- Use category/ naming for descriptive content grouping
- Implement camelCase for internal code variables
- Apply kebab-case for configuration and parameter names

### Phase 3: Validation Pattern Application
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "validation pattern application" as in_progress

Execute naming validation across system components:
- Validate command naming using verb-noun pattern verification
- Check file naming compliance with lowercase-hyphen standards
- Verify directory structure following organizational schemes
- Validate variable naming following type-appropriate conventions

### Phase 4: Standards Documentation & Enforcement
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "standards documentation" as in_progress

Document naming conventions with validation examples:
- Create comprehensive naming validation checklist
- Document correct and incorrect naming examples
- Establish naming pattern enforcement protocols
- Generate naming standards compliance report

Update TodoWrite complete all naming standards tasks

**Error Handling**: Identify naming pattern violations with correction recommendations, validate organizational scheme compliance, document variable naming inconsistencies, provide systematic correction guidance

**Single Responsibility**: Naming conventions establishment through verbo-sustantivo patterns, type-based consistency, systematic organization, and validation enforcement ensuring system-wide naming standardization.
