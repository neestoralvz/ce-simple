# /discover-information - Intelligent Information Discovery

**Purpose**: Context-aware information discovery with intelligent retrieval algorithms for knowledge gaps and research assistance.

**Integration**: Enhances 01-discovery workflows and supports 06-documentation with intelligent content gap identification.

**Complexity**: High - Uses AI-driven discovery patterns with context analysis and semantic understanding.

## Core Principles

**Context Intelligence**: Analyze current working environment and activity patterns for targeted discovery  
**Gap Detection**: Systematic identification of missing information and knowledge gaps  
**Semantic Understanding**: Context-aware retrieval with relationship mapping and relevance scoring  
**Progressive Discovery**: Layer analysis from surface patterns to deep knowledge relationships

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Context Analysis and Gap Detection

Execute intelligent analysis using Task Tool orchestration to identify information needs and knowledge gaps:

**Context Intelligence Tasks**:
- Analyze current working context and recent command history patterns
- Map existing knowledge base and documented information structures  
- Identify user intent patterns from project activity and command usage
- Detect contextual relationships and dependencies across system components

**Gap Detection Tasks**:
- Compare current knowledge against comprehensive project requirements
- Identify missing documentation, incomplete information, and outdated content
- Map knowledge gaps to priority levels based on usage frequency and critical paths
- Generate structured gap analysis with actionable remediation suggestions

Execute parallel analysis across project structure, documentation completeness, and semantic relationships.

### Phase 2: Intelligent Information Retrieval

Deploy context-aware search and discovery algorithms through coordinated task execution:

**Semantic Discovery Tasks**:
- Execute intelligent content discovery based on detected gaps and context patterns
- Apply context-aware filtering with relevance scoring for discovered information
- Retrieve external information when internal knowledge gaps are identified
- Cross-reference findings with existing knowledge base for consistency validation

**Adaptive Discovery Modes**:
- **Auto-Discovery**: Intelligent gap prioritization with system pattern analysis
- **Targeted Discovery**: Deep-dive analysis for specific topics or domains  
- **Gap Analysis**: Comprehensive information audit with systematic coverage mapping
- **Continuous Discovery**: Monitor for new gaps and maintain information currency

### Phase 3: Discovery Synthesis and Integration

Orchestrate comprehensive analysis compilation and actionable insight generation:

**Synthesis Tasks**:
- Organize findings by relevance, actionability, and implementation priority
- Generate discovery insights with specific recommendations and next steps
- Create knowledge integration suggestions linking discovered information to existing systems
- Produce structured discovery reports with executive summaries and detailed findings

**Integration Opportunities**:
- **01-discovery**: Enhanced exploration workflows with discovered information patterns
- **06-documentation**: Systematic documentation improvement based on comprehensive gap analysis
- **13-search**: Advanced search capabilities utilizing discovered content relationships
- **14-utils**: Utility integration for automated discovery workflows and continuous monitoring

### Phase 4: Reporting and Action Planning

Generate comprehensive discovery documentation and implementation roadmaps:

**Reporting Tasks**:
- Create executive summary with key discoveries and priority recommendations
- Generate detailed findings report with context analysis and gap documentation
- Provide actionable implementation steps with priority levels and resource requirements  
- Establish continuous discovery protocols for ongoing information maintenance

**Performance Metrics**:
- Context patterns analyzed and relationship mapping completeness
- Knowledge gaps detected with severity and impact assessment
- Semantic findings with relevance scoring and integration potential
- Discovery success rate and information retrieval accuracy measures

### Phase 5: Command Routing and Handoff

Execute intelligent workflow transitions based on discovery outcomes:

**Follow-up Command Routing**:
- Route to `/index-content` for comprehensive content indexing based on discoveries
- Handoff to `/search-advanced` for verification of information completeness and accuracy
- Transfer to `/filter-results` for discovery action prioritization and resource allocation
- Connect to `/docs-maintain` for systematic documentation enhancement workflows

**Workflow Integration**:
- Seamless transition to appropriate 01-discovery commands for deeper exploration
- Integration with 06-documentation workflows for gap remediation and content enhancement
- Connection to 08-learning commands for pattern capture and continuous improvement
- Handoff to 14-utils engines for automated discovery workflow implementation

## Advanced Features

**Context-Aware Processing**: Intelligent analysis focusing on high-value information discovery opportunities  
**Parallel Discovery**: Multiple discovery phases execute simultaneously for comprehensive coverage  
**Adaptive Depth**: Analysis complexity adjusts based on context requirements and available resources  
**Semantic Relationships**: Deep understanding of content connections and knowledge graph construction

## Integration Architecture

**Input Sources**: Project structure analysis, command history patterns, documentation completeness, external resources  
**Output Formats**: Structured reports, actionable insights, integration recommendations, workflow routing instructions  
**Cross-Category Enhancement**: Intelligent discovery capabilities enhance all command categories through context awareness
