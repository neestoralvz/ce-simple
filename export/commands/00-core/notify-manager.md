# notify-manager

## Purpose

Executes centralized notification management through intelligent routing providing complete visibility with audit trails across agents and workflow transitions.

## Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Focus on notification management without system operations
- **Granular Approach**: Break event capture into categorized units with clear routing
- **Resource Management**: Handle delegation tracking with explicit audit requirements
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in backup logging and alternative delivery paths

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Notification Capture
Mark "Notification Capture and Categorization" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute event detection:
- Capture system events across ce-simple components including agents
- Categorize notifications by type with intelligent classification
- Validate capture completeness ensuring no events missed
- Prepare notifications for routing with priority metadata

Use Bash to capture events:
- Event detection achieving system monitoring
- Classification algorithms with capture validation

If capture failures occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve capture error: backup logging"
- Execute retry with backup logging and manual entry
- Validate capture restoration ensuring event completeness
- Continue with validated event capture

Complete previous phase, mark "Routing Engine and Delivery Systems" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 2: Routing Engine
Mark "Routing Engine and Delivery Systems" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute intelligent delivery:
- Route notifications to appropriate agents and components
- Execute intelligent delivery using context-aware algorithms
- Manage delivery confirmation handling failed deliveries
- Maintain routing performance metrics optimizing pathways

Use Write to route notifications:
- Routing algorithms achieving context delivery
- Delivery systems with confirmation tracking

If routing issues occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve routing error: alternative paths"
- Execute notification queuing with alternative routing paths
- Validate delivery restoration ensuring notification reach
- Continue with validated routing configuration

Complete previous phase, mark "Status Aggregation and Consolidation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 3: Status Aggregation
Mark "Status Aggregation and Consolidation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute status consolidation:
- Consolidate notifications from sources into system reports
- Generate real-time status dashboards with current state
- Process status aggregation with error annotation capabilities
- Maintain consolidated view of system health metrics

Use Read to consolidate status:
- Status consolidation achieving comprehensive reports
- Dashboard generation with report processing

If aggregation problems occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve aggregation error: partial reports"
- Execute partial status reports with error annotations
- Validate aggregation restoration ensuring status visibility
- Continue with validated consolidation process

Complete previous phase, mark "Audit Management and Pattern Analytics" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 4: Audit Management
Mark "Audit Management and Pattern Analytics" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute audit maintenance:
- Maintain comprehensive audit trails with notification history
- Perform pattern analytics identifying trends and bottlenecks
- Generate audit trail insights with delegation analysis
- Establish continuous monitoring with automated pattern detection

Use Grep to analyze patterns:
- Audit trail management achieving history maintenance
- Pattern analytics with insight generation

If audit trail corruption occurs:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve audit corruption: log reconstruction"
- Execute reconstruction from distributed logs with integrity validation
- Validate audit restoration ensuring trail completeness
- Complete management with validated audit integrity

Complete all tasks using TodoWrite
