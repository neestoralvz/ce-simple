# /actions:recreate - Clean Slate Recreation

Specialist in recreating documents and components from scratch to eliminate accumulated complexity and ensure alignment with current standards.

## Purpose

Provide clean slate recreation of documents, configurations, or components that have accumulated complexity or drifted from current standards, ensuring fresh alignment without legacy bias.

## When to Use

- **Standard drift**: Document no longer follows current project conventions
- **Accumulated complexity**: Incremental changes have introduced unnecessary complexity  
- **Structural misalignment**: Core structure doesn't match current architecture
- **Legacy contamination**: Old approaches or patterns need complete refresh
- **Optimization opportunity**: Starting fresh would be more efficient than incremental fixes

## Recreation Process

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning
1. **Analyze current state** - identify specific issues with existing version
2. **Review current standards** - understand what the recreated version should achieve
3. **Validate recreation need** - confirm clean slate is better than incremental fixes
4. **Plan approach** - outline structure and key requirements for new version

### Phase 2: Context Loading
1. **Load current guidelines** - review established standards and patterns
2. **Understand requirements** - clarify what the component should accomplish
3. **Identify best practices** - apply current best practices and methodologies
4. **Clear mental model** - avoid contamination from previous version

### Phase 3: Clean Slate Creation
1. **Start fresh** - create new version without referencing old implementation
2. **Apply current standards** - use only current guidelines and best practices
3. **Build systematically** - construct with proper structure and organization
4. **Validate alignment** - ensure complete alignment with current standards

### Phase 4: Integration and Verification
1. **Test integration** - verify compatibility with related components
2. **Validate functionality** - confirm all requirements are met
3. **Check consistency** - ensure alignment with project ecosystem
4. **Document changes** - capture what was improved and why

## Anti-Bias Methodology

### Clean Slate Principles
- **Fresh perspective**: Approach the problem without preconceptions from old version
- **Current standards only**: Use only up-to-date guidelines and best practices
- **Optimal structure**: Design the best possible structure for current requirements
- **Zero legacy contamination**: Avoid copying patterns or decisions from old version

### Contamination Prevention
- **Don't reference old version** during creation process
- **Focus on requirements** rather than historical implementation
- **Apply systematic analysis** to determine optimal approach
- **Validate against current standards** rather than comparing to old version

## Quality Assurance

### Structural Analysis
**Think 1**: What function should this component serve according to current standards?
**Think 2**: What is the optimal structure for current requirements?
**Think 3**: How can we prevent contamination from previous versions?
**Think 4**: How do we validate complete alignment with updated guidelines?

### Validation Criteria
- **Complete alignment**: 100% compliance with current standards
- **Optimal structure**: Best possible organization for requirements
- **Zero legacy issues**: No contamination from previous versions
- **Integration success**: Works seamlessly with current ecosystem

## Integration Points

### Related Commands
- **Documentation work**: /actions:write for documentation that needs recreation
- **Content analysis**: /actions:research for understanding current best practices
- **Quality validation**: /maintenance:maintain for post-recreation verification

### Authority Chain
Current project standards → Best practices research → Clean recreation → Integration validation

## Success Indicators

### Immediate Success
- Component follows all current standards and conventions
- Structure is optimal for current requirements
- No legacy complexity or outdated patterns remain
- Integration with ecosystem is seamless

### Long-term Success
- Component remains maintainable and extensible
- Standards compliance prevents future drift
- Clean architecture supports project evolution
- No regression in functionality or capability

## Best Practices

- **Thorough analysis**: Understand exactly why recreation is needed
- **Standards focus**: Base all decisions on current best practices
- **Systematic approach**: Use methodical process to ensure quality
- **Complete validation**: Verify all aspects before considering complete
- **Documentation**: Capture rationale and improvements made
