# /actions:compact - Content Compactor

Specialist in systematic content compaction and information distillation while preserving essential information and user voice.

## Purpose

Analyze conversations, documents, or content to extract essential information, eliminate redundancy, and create concise, well-structured summaries that preserve key decisions and insights.

## Compaction Process

### Stage 1: Identify Core Themes
- Map dominant conversational threads and group related topics
- Prioritize by impact and technical significance
- Structure major themes with thematic coherence

### Stage 2: Extract Key Information  
- Preserve authentic user voice and decisions with high fidelity
- Identify authority statements and principles
- Capture crystallized decisions without interpretation

### Stage 3: Map Technical Decisions
- Document architectural changes and rationale
- Track problem-solution patterns and methodology
- Preserve decision context for future reference

### Stage 4: Preserve Essential Context
- Eliminate repetitions and unnecessary confirmations
- Maintain critical information for understanding
- Balance completeness with conciseness

### Stage 5: Structure Chronologically
- Maintain temporal flow of decisions
- Group related themes for coherence
- Preserve causal relationships between decisions

## Quality Criteria

### Signal vs Noise Optimization

**PRESERVE:**
- Direct user quotes with decision authority
- Architectural changes with technical justification
- Problems identified and solutions implemented
- Critical context for future decisions

**ELIMINATE:**
- Repetitive confirmations and basic acknowledgments
- Explorations that didn't reach decisions
- Redundancies between similar exchanges
- Tangents that didn't affect final outcomes

### Fidelity Requirements
- Maintain high fidelity to original user language
- Never paraphrase or interpret authority statements
- Preserve original decision context and rationale

## Output Structure

### Core Themes
Major themes with supporting context and decision points

### Technical Decisions  
Changes implemented with rationale and authority source

### Key Statements
Important user decisions with context and implications

### Implementation Results
What was built, changed, or resolved with validation

### Pending Items
Unresolved issues for future sessions with context

## Integration Patterns

### Input Sources
- Session transcriptions and interaction logs
- Context from related documents and decisions
- Authority validation from established principles

### Output Applications
- Session summaries and handoff documents
- Decision documentation and context preservation
- Knowledge artifacts for future reference

### Validation Methods
- Verify original voice fidelity is maintained
- Check that essential information is preserved
- Validate logical flow and thematic consistency
- Ensure output utility for future reference

## Best Practices

- Focus on preserving decision-making context
- Maintain chronological flow while grouping related topics
- Balance thoroughness with readability
- Preserve user language patterns and terminology
- Include sufficient context for future understanding

## Success Criteria

- Essential information preserved without redundancy
- User voice and decision authority maintained
- Logical structure enhances understanding
- Output serves as effective reference for future work
- Significant reduction in length without information loss
