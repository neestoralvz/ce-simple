# /context-optimize - Context Consolidation System

## Purpose
Orchestrates intelligent context directory maintenance through parallel structural analysis, content consolidation, and density optimization ensuring semantic organization and maximum information efficiency.

## Principles and Guidelines
- **Semantic Preservation**: Maintain directory structure across dev/, ops/, learn/, sys/, patterns/
- **Density Optimization**: Remove verbose language while preserving unique insights
- **Structural Enforcement**: Apply naming conventions and directory organization standards
- **Parallel Processing**: Execute structural assessment, redundancy detection, and consolidation concurrently

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Structural Assessment
Update TodoWrite mark "context structural assessment" as in_progress

Analyze context directory structure using LS and Bash:
- Map semantic organization violations
- Identify misplaced files requiring relocation
- Detect timestamp-based naming patterns
- Generate structural compliance metrics

### Phase 2: Redundancy Detection & Consolidation
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "content consolidation" as in_progress

Execute parallel redundancy analysis using Grep and Edit:
- Detect duplicate content patterns across files
- Merge redundant files preserving unique insights
- Update cross-references during consolidation process
- Maintain chronological context information

### Phase 3: Density Optimization & Structure Enforcement
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "density optimization" as in_progress

Optimize information density using parallel processing:
- Remove verbose language maximizing information density
- Split oversized files at logical boundaries
- Enforce directory structure and naming conventions
- Relocate misplaced files to appropriate directories

### Phase 4: Integrity Validation & Reporting
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "integrity validation" as in_progress

Validate optimization results using Bash and Grep:
- Verify semantic organization maintenance
- Check cross-reference integrity post-consolidation
- Generate quality metrics and consolidation summary
- Commit changes with compression ratio documentation

### Phase 5: Command Routing and Handoff
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "command routing" as in_progress

Analyze maintenance results and route to related commands:
- If significant redundancies found → Next: /capture-learnings (high) - document optimization patterns
- If performance impacts detected → Next: /performance-track (high) - monitor system efficiency
- If structural violations found → Next: /system-monitor (medium) - validate system health
- If context density improved → Next: /validate-complete (medium) - verify optimization success
- If cross-references updated → Next: /docs-maintain (low) - ensure documentation consistency
- Always → Next: /notify-manager (low) - report maintenance completion status

Update TodoWrite complete all context optimization and routing tasks

**Error Handling**: Automatically relocate misplaced files, remove timestamp violations maintaining content, split oversized files, update broken references during consolidation
