# explore-codebase

## Purpose

Executes systematic internal codebase exploration through parallel architectural analysis providing complete understanding with development guidance and implementation patterns.

## Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Focus on internal codebase analysis without external research
- **Granular Approach**: Break exploration into parallel analyses with clear domains
- **Resource Management**: Handle architectural mapping with explicit coverage requirements
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in graceful degradation and scope adjustment protocols

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Discovery Initialization
Mark "Discovery Initialization" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute scope assessment:
- Initialize codebase scope assessment and directory validation
- Establish parallel analysis streams for architecture and patterns
- Create discovery tracking system ensuring comprehensive coverage
- Configure error handling protocols for access restrictions

Use LS to validate directories:
- Directory validation achieving accessibility confirmation
- Scope assessment with baseline metrics

If directory access errors occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve access error: working directory fallback"
- Execute fallback to current working directory with validation
- Validate access restoration ensuring exploration capability
- Continue with validated directory scope

Complete previous phase, mark "Parallel Domain Analysis" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 2: Parallel Domain Analysis
Mark "Parallel Domain Analysis" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute concurrent exploration:
- Launch structure analysis mapping directory organization
- Deploy pattern discovery extracting coding conventions
- Initiate configuration review analyzing build systems
- Execute documentation analysis reviewing specifications

Use Glob to map structure:
- Structure analysis achieving directory mapping
- Pattern discovery with convention extraction

If analysis tasks fail:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve analysis error: reduced scope"
- Execute retry with reduced scope maintaining coverage
- Validate analysis completeness ensuring domain coverage
- Continue with alternative analysis paths

Complete previous phase, mark "Cross-Validation and Pattern Integration" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 3: Cross-Validation Integration
Mark "Cross-Validation and Pattern Integration" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute pattern consolidation:
- Cross-validate findings across analysis domains for consistency
- Resolve conflicts through evidence-based prioritization
- Extract unified architectural patterns from results
- Identify critical insights requiring deeper investigation

Use Grep to validate patterns:
- Cross-validation achieving consistency verification
- Conflict resolution with evidence prioritization

If conflicts occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve conflict: evidence validation"
- Execute evidence-based prioritization with multiple sources
- Validate resolution completeness ensuring accurate understanding
- Continue with validated architectural patterns

Complete previous phase, mark "Comprehensive Synthesis and Documentation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 4: Synthesis Documentation
Mark "Comprehensive Synthesis and Documentation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute comprehensive synthesis:
- Synthesize comprehensive codebase understanding from analysis domains
- Document discovered patterns and architectural decisions with evidence
- Generate actionable insights for development team guidance
- Create reference documentation for future exploration sessions

Use Write to create documentation:
- Synthesis processing achieving comprehensive understanding
- Documentation generation with evidence attribution

If synthesis gaps occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve synthesis gap: additional analysis"
- Execute additional targeted analysis with refined scope
- Validate synthesis completeness ensuring guidance capability
- Complete documentation with validated architectural intelligence

Complete all tasks using TodoWrite
