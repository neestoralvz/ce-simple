# 03-analysis - Analysis & Assessment Commands

## Purpose
Deep technical analysis and complexity assessment. These commands evaluate technical feasibility, performance implications, and provide detailed insights for informed decision-making.

## Commands
- `/think-layers` - Progressive analysis for complex problems
- `/complexity-assess` - Technical complexity evaluation and assessment methodology
- `/analyze-parallel` - Parallel processing analysis and optimization strategies
- `/problem-solving` - Systematic problem decomposition and solution frameworks
- `/performance-analyze` - Performance impact assessment
- `/feasibility-check` - Implementation feasibility validation
- `/impact-analyze` - Change impact analysis across systems

## Category Relations
- **Triggered by**: 01-discovery, 02-planning
- **Coordinates with**: 12-math for quantitative analysis
- **Feeds into**: 04-execution, 05-validation
- **Uses**: 14-utils for data processing and metrics

## Usage Patterns
```
02-planning/architect → 03-analysis/complexity → 12-math/calculate
01-discovery/explore → 03-analysis/think-layers → 02-planning/optimize
03-analysis/feasibility → 05-validation/prepare → 04-execution/implement
```

## Analysis Methodology
- **Layer 1**: Surface-level assessment and quick wins
- **Layer 2**: Intermediate complexity and dependencies
- **Layer 3**: Deep technical analysis and edge cases
- **Layer 4**: System-wide implications and integration

## Assessment Dimensions
- Technical complexity and implementation difficulty
- Performance implications and optimization opportunities
- Resource requirements and timeline estimates
- Risk factors and mitigation strategies
- Integration points and dependency chains

## Analysis Outputs
- Complexity matrices with difficulty ratings
- Performance benchmarks and optimization recommendations
- Feasibility reports with go/no-go decisions
- Impact assessments with change propagation maps
- Technical debt analysis and remediation plans
