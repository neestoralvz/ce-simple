# problem-solving

## Purpose

Executes universal methodology for systematic problem resolution through structured diagnosis providing comprehensive research with progressive analysis and executable solution plans.

## Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Focus on problem analysis without solution implementation
- **Granular Approach**: Break problem resolution into manageable analysis steps with clear phases
- **Resource Management**: Handle investigation phases with explicit validation requirements
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in analysis failure handling and methodology adjustment protocols

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Problem Structural Assessment
Mark "Problem structural assessment" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute structural mapping:
- Map problem domain scope and affected components
- Document structural constraints and system dependencies
- Search for error keywords and failure patterns
- Identify constraint and limitation references

Use Grep to find patterns:
- Pattern detection achieving context identification
- Scope mapping with constraint documentation

If scope completeness issues occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve scope error: domain expansion"
- Execute domain expansion with comprehensive mapping
- Validate scope restoration ensuring problem coverage
- Continue with validated structural assessment

Complete previous phase, mark "Internal context discovery" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 2: Internal Discovery
Mark "Internal context discovery" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute internal research:
- Execute explore-codebase for internal context discovery
- Focus exploration on problem domain and components
- Gather existing documentation and implementation patterns
- Identify internal resources and potential solutions

Use TodoWrite to execute explore-codebase:
- Internal research achieving context discovery
- Pattern extraction with resource identification

If internal context gaps occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve context gap: additional exploration"
- Execute additional exploration with refined focus
- Validate context completeness ensuring resource coverage
- Continue with validated internal findings

Complete previous phase, mark "External research execution" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 3: External Research
Mark "External research execution" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute external coordination:
- Execute explore-web for external solution research
- Research industry best practices and standard approaches
- Gather expert recommendations and proven solutions
- Cross-validate external findings with internal context

Use TodoWrite to execute explore-web:
- External research achieving solution discovery
- Pattern synthesis with feasibility assessment

If research quality issues occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve quality gap: validation enhancement"
- Execute validation enhancement with quality assurance
- Validate research completeness ensuring solution coverage
- Continue with validated external research

Complete previous phase, mark "Solution analysis and development" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 4: Solution Development
Mark "Solution analysis and development" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute progressive analysis:
- Execute think-layers for deep problem analysis
- Apply multi-layer thinking to solution development
- Generate solution alternatives and evaluation criteria
- Develop comprehensive solution strategy

Use TodoWrite to execute think-layers:
- Progressive analysis achieving solution development
- Strategy generation with implementation guidance

If analysis methodology issues occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve methodology gap: phase adjustment"
- Execute problematic analysis phases with adjustments
- Validate methodology effectiveness ensuring solution quality
- Complete analysis with validated executable solution plan

Complete all tasks using TodoWrite
