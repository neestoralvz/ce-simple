# Validation Engine - Multi-Domain Validation Orchestration

## Purpose
Centralized validation orchestration system providing standardized multi-domain validation coordination, parallel validation execution, result aggregation, and comprehensive assessment reporting across all validation workflows.

## Core Engine Functions

### Phase 1: Multi-Domain Setup Configuration
```
Update TodoWrite: Mark "Multi-domain validation setup" as in_progress

Initialize validation orchestration:
- Configure parallel validation channels for specified domains
- Set up cross-validation dependencies and priority weighting  
- Define escalation protocols for validation failures
- Prepare success criteria and quality gate thresholds
- Initialize domain-specific validation environments
```

### Phase 2: Parallel Validation Execution
```
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Parallel validation execution" as in_progress

Execute multi-domain validation tracks:
- Launch `/validate-code` for technical quality assessment
- Launch `/validate-creative` for originality and engagement assessment  
- Launch `/validate-visual` for UX and accessibility validation
- Launch `/validate-complete` for requirement verification
- Monitor validation progress across all active domains
```

### Phase 3: Cross-Domain Result Aggregation
```
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Cross-domain result aggregation" as in_progress

Aggregate validation results:
- Collect results from all validation tracks
- Apply weighted scoring based on domain priorities
- Identify cross-domain conflicts and integration issues
- Generate holistic system health assessment
- Prepare unified validation dataset for reporting
```

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Assessment Generation
```
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Comprehensive assessment generation" as in_progress

Compile integrated validation report:
- Create priority-ranked issue assessment across domains
- Document validation results with specific findings
- Generate actionable improvement recommendations
- Prepare comprehensive compliance record
- Create remediation roadmap with domain-specific fixes
```

### Phase 5: Command Routing and Handoff
```
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Validation workflow handoff" as in_progress

Route to appropriate continuation workflow:
- If validation passes: Execute `/handoff-manager` to next phase
- If issues found: Route to domain-specific remediation commands
- If critical failures: Escalate to `/problem-solving` for systematic resolution
- Update project context via `/context-engine` with validation results
- Notify stakeholders via `/notify-manager` of validation completion status
```

## Standard Validation Configurations

### Quick Start Templates
```javascript
// Security: ['code', 'infrastructure', 'data'] - vulnerability_scanning + compliance_audit
// Performance: ['code', 'visual', 'infrastructure'] - efficiency + optimization + scalability  
// User Experience: ['visual', 'creative', 'functional'] - accessibility + usability + engagement
```

### Complete Multi-Domain Orchestration
```
Update TodoWrite: Mark "Complete multi-domain validation" as in_progress

Execute comprehensive validation workflow:
- Initialize parallel validation channels for all domains
- Launch simultaneous validation across creative, technical, visual, and completion tracks
- Monitor cross-domain validation progress and dependencies
- Aggregate results with weighted scoring and priority ranking
- Generate integrated assessment with actionable recommendations
- Route to appropriate continuation workflow based on results
```

## Error Recovery and Remediation

### Validation Failure Recovery Protocol
```
If validation failures occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "CRITICAL: Resolve validation failures in [domain]"
- Route to `/problem-solving` for systematic failure analysis
- Implement domain-specific recovery strategies via appropriate validation commands
- Execute `/validate-complete` for comprehensive re-validation
- Update project status via `/notify-manager` with recovery progress
```

### Cross-Domain Integration Recovery
```
If cross-domain integration failures detected:
- Add TodoWrite task: "CRITICAL: Resolve cross-domain integration failure"
- Halt multi-domain validation until integration resolved
- Route to `/agent-orchestration` for coordinated resolution
- Execute comprehensive cross-domain re-validation before continuation
- Update system context via `/context-engine` with integration status
```

## Engine Integration Patterns

### Core Command Integration
- **Pre-validation**: `/context-engine` - Synchronize project state before validation
- **Domain Validation**: `/validate-[domain]` - Execute specific domain validation
- **Post-validation**: `/handoff-manager` - Route to appropriate next phase
- **Error Handling**: `/problem-solving` - Systematic failure resolution
- **Notification**: `/notify-manager` - Stakeholder communication

### Parallel Execution Framework
```
Execute validation engine with parallel orchestration:
- Use `/agent-orchestration` for multi-domain coordination
- Apply `/load-balance` for validation workload distribution
- Integrate `/result-consolidate` for cross-domain result aggregation
- Route through `/phase-manager` for workflow state management
```

### Quality Assurance Integration
```
Comprehensive validation coverage via:
- 05-validation commands for domain-specific validation
- 10-standards templates for consistent criteria  
- 08-learning commands for pattern capture
- 14-utils engines for specialized coordination
```
