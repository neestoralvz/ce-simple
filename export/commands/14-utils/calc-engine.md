# Expert Assembly Engine - Dynamic Expert Panel Calculator

## Purpose
Dynamic expert assembly calculation engine implementing Expert Panel Assembly paradigm with domain-driven scaling and synergy optimization for optimal AI orchestration.

## Principles and Guidelines

**Expert-First Thinking**: Focus on expertise requirements rather than mathematical formulas
**Dynamic Scaling**: Expert count determined by domain complexity and synergy potential
**Domain Analysis**: Comprehensive evaluation of required expertise areas
**Synergy Optimization**: Configure expert panels for maximum collaborative value

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Domain Analysis and Expert Identification
Update TodoWrite: Mark "Domain expertise analysis" as in_progress

Analyze domain requirements and identify needed expertise:
- Evaluate problem scope and complexity dimensions
- Identify required domains of knowledge and specialization
- Assess interdisciplinary requirements and cross-domain needs
- Determine quality standards and validation requirements

Use Bash for domain analysis:
```bash
# Core question implementation
echo "EXPERT_ASSEMBLY_QUESTION: ¿Cuál es el grupo de expertos que mejor puede abordar este tema?"
echo "DOMAIN_ANALYSIS: Evaluating expertise requirements..."

# Domain complexity assessment
if [[ "$scope" =~ technical.*architecture|system.*design|scalability ]]; then
    domains+=("Technical Architecture Expert")
fi
if [[ "$scope" =~ user.*experience|interface|workflow ]]; then
    domains+=("User Experience Expert")
fi
if [[ "$scope" =~ business.*logic|domain.*specific|industry ]]; then
    domains+=("Domain-Specific Expert")
fi
if [[ "$scope" =~ quality|testing|validation|security ]]; then
    domains+=("Quality Assurance Expert")
fi
if [[ "$scope" =~ strategy|vision|competitive|market ]]; then
    domains+=("Strategic Vision Expert")
fi
```

### Phase 2: Expert Panel Assembly with Synergy Analysis
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Expert panel assembly optimization" as in_progress

Execute expert panel assembly based on domain requirements:

Use Bash for expert assembly:
```bash
# Dynamic expert panel assembly
expert_count=${#domains[@]}
echo "IDENTIFIED_DOMAINS: ${domains[*]}"
echo "BASE_EXPERT_COUNT: $expert_count"

# Synergy optimization analysis
if [ "$expert_count" -gt 1 ]; then
    # Multi-domain synergy potential
    synergy_factor=1
    for domain in "${domains[@]}"; do
        for other_domain in "${domains[@]}"; do
            if [[ "$domain" != "$other_domain" ]]; then
                ((synergy_factor++))
            fi
        done
    done
    
    # Optimize for collaboration
    if [ "$synergy_factor" -gt 5 ]; then
        echo "HIGH_SYNERGY_POTENTIAL: Enhanced expert collaboration possible"
        collaborative_enhancement="ENABLED"
    fi
fi
```

### Phase 3: Dynamic Scaling Based on Complexity and Quality Requirements
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Dynamic scaling optimization" as in_progress

Determine optimal expert panel size based on complexity and requirements:

Use Bash for dynamic scaling:
```bash
# Dynamic scaling algorithm - no fixed ranges
scaling_factors=()

# Domain breadth factor
if [ "$expert_count" -le 2 ]; then
    scaling_factors+=("FOCUSED")
elif [ "$expert_count" -le 4 ]; then
    scaling_factors+=("DIVERSE")
else
    scaling_factors+=("COMPREHENSIVE")
fi

# Complexity amplification
if [[ "$breadth" =~ high|complex|advanced ]]; then
    scaling_factors+=("AMPLIFIED")
    echo "COMPLEXITY_AMPLIFICATION: Adding specialized experts for complex requirements"
fi

# Quality requirements
if [[ "$quality_requirements" =~ critical|high|enterprise ]]; then
    scaling_factors+=("QUALITY_ENHANCED")
    echo "QUALITY_ENHANCEMENT: Adding validation experts for high standards"
fi

# Time criticality
if [[ "$timeline" =~ urgent|immediate|fast ]]; then
    scaling_factors+=("PARALLEL_OPTIMIZED")
    echo "PARALLEL_OPTIMIZATION: Optimizing for speed through expert parallelization"
fi
```

### Phase 4: Expert Assembly Strategy and Recommendation Generation
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Expert assembly strategy generation" as in_progress

Generate expert assembly strategy and deployment recommendations:

Use Bash for strategy generation:
```bash
# Generate expert assembly strategy
case "${scaling_factors[*]}" in
    *FOCUSED*)
        strategy="focused-expert"
        recommendation="Deploy focused expert panel for specific domain solutions"
        ;;
    *DIVERSE*)
        strategy="diverse-expert-team"
        recommendation="Deploy diverse expert team for cross-functional challenges"
        ;;
    *COMPREHENSIVE*)
        strategy="comprehensive-expert-panel"
        recommendation="Deploy comprehensive expert panel for complex multi-domain work"
        ;;
    *AMPLIFIED*COMPREHENSIVE*)
        strategy="extensive-expert-assembly"
        recommendation="Deploy extensive expert assembly for strategic complexity"
        ;;
esac

# Add enhancement modifiers
if [[ "${scaling_factors[*]}" =~ QUALITY_ENHANCED ]]; then
    strategy="${strategy}-quality-enhanced"
fi
if [[ "${scaling_factors[*]}" =~ PARALLEL_OPTIMIZED ]]; then
    strategy="${strategy}-parallel-optimized"
fi
```

Generate final expert assembly output:
```bash
echo "EXPERT_ASSEMBLY_STRATEGY: $strategy"
echo "EXPERT_DOMAINS: ${domains[*]}"
echo "EXPERT_COUNT: $expert_count"
echo "SCALING_FACTORS: ${scaling_factors[*]}"
echo "RECOMMENDATION: $recommendation"
echo "SYNERGY_POTENTIAL: $collaborative_enhancement"
echo "ASSEMBLY_VALIDATION: EXPERT_PANEL_OPTIMIZED"
```
