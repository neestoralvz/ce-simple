# strategy-optimize

## Purpose

Executes strategic plan optimization through comprehensive analysis providing refined implementation strategy with efficiency enhancement and risk-adjusted optimization.

## Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Focus on plan optimization without execution implementation
- **Granular Approach**: Break optimization into systematic refinement with clear improvement criteria
- **Resource Management**: Handle complexity optimization with explicit efficiency and performance validation
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in optimization iteration protocols and refinement strategies

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Plan Analysis and Efficiency Assessment
Mark "Plan Analysis and Efficiency Assessment" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute comprehensive evaluation:
- Analyze existing plans from architect-solution, plan-phases, risk-assess, and resource-plan
- Identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities across all planning dimensions
- Assess plan coherence and integration ensuring consistent strategy alignment
- Establish baseline metrics for optimization measurement and improvement tracking

Use Read to analyze plans:
- Multi-plan analysis achieving comprehensive assessment
- Efficiency evaluation with bottleneck identification

If analysis gaps occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve analysis gap: plan clarification"
- Execute targeted plan review with missing information validation
- Validate analysis completeness ensuring optimization capability
- Continue with complete plan understanding

Complete previous phase, mark "Resource Reallocation and Timeline Refinement" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 2: Resource and Timeline Optimization
Mark "Resource Reallocation and Timeline Refinement" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute optimization refinement:
- Optimize resource allocation eliminating waste and improving utilization efficiency
- Refine timeline estimates based on optimization analysis and capacity rebalancing
- Identify parallel execution opportunities reducing critical path dependencies
- Design load balancing strategies maximizing team productivity and delivery speed

Use Write to document optimization:
- Resource optimization achieving efficiency improvement
- Timeline refinement with parallel execution enhancement

If optimization conflicts occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve optimization conflict: constraint rebalancing"
- Execute constraint analysis with feasibility validation and trade-off evaluation
- Validate optimization viability ensuring implementation capability
- Continue with balanced optimization parameters

Complete previous phase, mark "Risk-Adjusted Optimization and Contingency Integration" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 3: Risk-Adjusted Optimization
Mark "Risk-Adjusted Optimization and Contingency Integration" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute risk integration:
- Integrate risk mitigation strategies into optimized plans ensuring robustness
- Adjust optimization recommendations based on risk probability and impact analysis
- Design contingency integration maintaining optimization benefits under uncertainty
- Establish risk-adjusted performance metrics balancing efficiency with resilience

Use Write to integrate risk:
- Risk integration achieving optimization robustness
- Contingency planning with efficiency preservation

If risk integration issues occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve risk issue: optimization adjustment"
- Execute risk-optimization rebalancing with stakeholder validation
- Validate risk-adjusted feasibility ensuring delivery confidence
- Continue with resilient optimization framework

Complete previous phase, mark "Final Plan Validation and Readiness Assessment" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 4: Final Validation and Readiness
Mark "Final Plan Validation and Readiness Assessment" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute final validation:
- Validate optimized plans against original requirements ensuring complete coverage
- Assess implementation readiness with team capability and resource availability verification
- Generate comprehensive optimization report with improvement metrics and recommendations
- Establish execution handoff criteria and success monitoring framework

Use Write to generate final plans:
- Plan validation achieving requirement satisfaction
- Readiness assessment with execution preparation

If validation failures occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve validation failure: final refinement"
- Execute targeted plan adjustment with requirement realignment
- Validate final plan quality ensuring execution readiness
- Complete optimization with validated implementation strategy

Complete all tasks using TodoWrite
