# resource-plan

## Purpose

Executes intelligent resource allocation through systematic capacity analysis providing structured timeline estimation with team optimization and budget planning.

## Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Focus on resource planning without execution management
- **Granular Approach**: Break resource needs into specific allocations with clear capacity requirements
- **Resource Management**: Handle allocation complexity with explicit optimization and constraint validation
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in capacity adjustment protocols and reallocation strategies

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Resource Requirements Analysis
Mark "Resource Requirements Analysis and Capacity Assessment" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute requirements gathering:
- Analyze phase plans extracting specific resource needs and skill requirements
- Assess current team capacity and availability constraints for planning
- Identify resource gaps and external dependency requirements
- Establish resource baseline with current utilization metrics

Use Read to analyze requirements:
- Phase analysis achieving resource extraction
- Capacity assessment with availability validation

If requirements analysis failures occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve resource gap: capacity clarification"
- Execute targeted capacity analysis with stakeholder input validation
- Validate requirements completeness ensuring allocation capability
- Continue with validated resource parameters

Complete previous phase, mark "Team Allocation and Skill Matching" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 2: Team Allocation
Mark "Team Allocation and Skill Matching" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute team planning:
- Match team members to tasks based on skill requirements and availability
- Optimize team composition balancing workload and expertise distribution
- Identify skill gaps requiring training or external resource acquisition
- Design team coordination patterns and communication structures

Use Write to document allocation:
- Team allocation achieving skill optimization
- Coordination planning with communication structure definition

If allocation conflicts occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve allocation conflict: capacity rebalancing"
- Execute team rebalancing with skill gap analysis and mitigation
- Validate allocation feasibility ensuring delivery capability
- Continue with optimized team structure

Complete previous phase, mark "Timeline Estimation and Buffer Calculation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 3: Timeline Estimation
Mark "Timeline Estimation and Buffer Calculation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute timeline development:
- Calculate realistic timeline estimates based on resource capacity and task complexity
- Apply buffer calculations for risk mitigation and uncertainty management
- Create milestone timeline with delivery checkpoints and review gates
- Establish critical path analysis with bottleneck identification and resolution

Use Write to plan timeline:
- Timeline calculation achieving realistic estimation
- Buffer planning with risk mitigation strategies

If timeline validation issues occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve timeline issue: estimation refinement"
- Execute timeline adjustment with capacity constraint validation
- Validate timeline feasibility ensuring resource alignment
- Continue with validated timeline parameters

Complete previous phase, mark "Budget Estimation and Resource Optimization" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 4: Budget and Optimization
Mark "Budget Estimation and Resource Optimization" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute budget planning:
- Generate comprehensive budget estimates including team costs and external resources
- Identify optimization opportunities for cost reduction and efficiency improvement
- Create resource allocation recommendations with ROI analysis and justification
- Establish monitoring framework for resource utilization tracking and adjustment

Use Write to generate estimates:
- Budget estimation achieving cost completeness
- Optimization recommendations with efficiency analysis

If budget constraints occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve budget constraint: optimization iteration"
- Execute cost optimization with resource reallocation analysis
- Validate budget feasibility ensuring project viability
- Complete planning with optimized resource allocation framework

Complete all tasks using TodoWrite
