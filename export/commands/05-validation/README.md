# 05-validation - Validation & Quality Commands

## Purpose
Comprehensive quality assurance and validation systems. These commands ensure implementation correctness, performance standards, and system integrity through automated and intelligent validation processes.

## Commands
- `/validate-implementation` - Comprehensive implementation validation
- `/test-orchestrate` - Intelligent test execution coordination
- `/quality-gates` - Quality gate enforcement and reporting
- `/performance-validate` - Performance benchmarking and validation
- `/integrity-check` - System integrity and consistency validation

## Category Relations
- **Triggered by**: 04-execution during and after implementation
- **Coordinates with**: 12-math for metrics analysis
- **Feeds back to**: 04-execution for corrections
- **Reports to**: 08-learning for improvement patterns

## Usage Patterns
```
04-execution/implement → 05-validation/validate → 08-learning/capture
02-planning/architect → 05-validation/gates → 04-execution/execute
05-validation/performance → 12-math/analyze → 07-maintenance/optimize
```

## Validation Framework
- **Functional Validation**: Feature correctness and behavior verification
- **Performance Validation**: Speed, efficiency, and resource usage
- **Integration Validation**: System-wide compatibility and interaction
- **Quality Validation**: Code quality, standards compliance, maintainability

## Quality Metrics
- Implementation correctness and completeness
- Performance benchmarks and regression detection
- Code quality scores and standard compliance
- Integration test coverage and success rates
- System reliability and stability indicators

## Validation Outputs
- Comprehensive validation reports with pass/fail status
- Performance benchmarks with historical comparisons
- Quality scorecards with improvement recommendations
- Integration compatibility matrices
- System health dashboards with trend analysis
