# Validate Complete - Validation Command

## Purpose
Orchestrates comprehensive system validation through parallel execution of creative, technical, and visual validation with integrated assessment reporting and multi-domain quality assurance coordination.

## Principles and Guidelines

- **Single Responsibility**: Focus exclusively on multi-domain validation orchestration without handling individual validation tasks
- **Granular Validation**: Break validation orchestration into small, manageable validation phases with clear domain coordination
- **Domain Management**: Clear validation dependencies with explicit cross-domain integration and assessment checkpoints
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in validation failure handling and recovery protocols with domain-specific remediation strategies

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Validation Orchestration Setup
Update TodoWrite: Mark "Complete validation setup" as in_progress

Initialize parallel validation channels:
- Configure creative validation track parameters
- Set up technical validation track requirements
- Initialize visual validation track specifications
- Define cross-validation dependencies and priority weighting

Establish integrated reporting framework:
- Set up multi-domain result aggregation systems
- Configure weighted scoring and assessment criteria
- Define escalation protocols for validation failures
- Prepare success criteria and quality gate thresholds

### Phase 2: Parallel Multi-Domain Validation Execution
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Multi-domain validation execution" as in_progress

Execute creative validation track:
- Execute `/validate-creative` for originality and engagement assessment
- Monitor creative validation progress and results
- Validate creative output quality against standards
- Document creative validation findings

Execute technical and visual validation tracks:
- Execute `/validate-code` for technical quality assessment
- Execute `/validate-visual` for UX and accessibility validation
- Monitor validation progress across all domains
- Validate cross-domain compatibility and integration

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Assessment and Integration
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Cross-domain assessment" as in_progress

Aggregate validation results across domains:
- Collect results from all validation tracks
- Apply weighted scoring based on priority settings
- Identify cross-domain conflicts and integration issues
- Generate holistic system health assessment

Analyze system coherence and reliability:
- Validate end-to-end user experience consistency
- Check system reliability across validation dimensions
- Assess integration quality between domains
- Generate improvement matrix with priority rankings

### Phase 4: Integrated Feedback and Resolution
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Validation feedback integration" as in_progress

Compile comprehensive validation report:
- Create integrated assessment with priority-ranked issues
- Document validation results across all domains
- Generate specific improvement recommendations
- Prepare comprehensive compliance record

Orchestrate remediation if needed:
- Identify failed validation domains requiring attention
- Execute targeted remediation across affected areas
- Coordinate re-validation cycles until quality gates pass
- Document system certification with compliance evidence

If multi-domain validation failures occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve validation failure: [specific domain/issue]"
- Implement domain-specific recovery strategies
- Re-execute failed validation components with adjustments
- Validate recovery success across all affected domains

Update TodoWrite: Complete all complete validation tasks
Add follow-up: "Multi-domain validation complete with integrated assessment ready"

**Single Responsibility**: Validation orchestrator focused exclusively on multi-domain validation coordination without individual domain validation responsibilities.
