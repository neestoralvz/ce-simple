# Git Worktree - Parallel Development Environment Manager

## Purpose
Automate git worktree creation, management, and coordination for parallel AI development workflows with intelligent lifecycle tracking and session coordination.

## Principles and Guidelines
- **Quick Setup**: Rapid worktree creation for feature branches with automated environment preparation
- **Batch Operations**: Manage multiple worktrees simultaneously with intelligent coordination
- **Cleanup Intelligence**: Remove orphaned and completed worktrees with automated lifecycle management
- **Sync Coordination**: Coordinate changes across worktrees with development workflow integration

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Worktree Status Assessment and Planning
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "List existing worktrees and analyze current worktree status", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "worktree-status-1"},
  {"content": "Check remote branches for worktree creation options", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "worktree-branches-1"}
])
```

### Phase 2: Worktree Creation and Setup
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "Create new worktree with session branch generation", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "worktree-create-1"},
  {"content": "Verify worktree setup and branch checkout status", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "worktree-verify-1"}
])
```

### Phase 3: Parallel Development Coordination
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "Coordinate multiple worktrees for parallel development workflows", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "worktree-coordinate-1"},
  {"content": "Integrate with development monitoring and performance tracking systems", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "worktree-integrate-1"}
])
```

### Phase 4: Lifecycle Management and Session Tracking
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "Track worktree operations and log session activities", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "worktree-track-1"},
  {"content": "Monitor worktree health and coordinate cleanup when appropriate", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "worktree-health-1"}
])
```
