# /calculate-complexity - Technical Complexity Quantification

## Purpose
Executes comprehensive technical complexity quantification with 4-decimal precision providing mathematical assessment for deployment strategy and resource allocation decisions.

## Principles and Guidelines
- **Mathematical Precision**: Enforce 4-decimal precision using bc calculations with validation
- **Comprehensive Assessment**: Analyze scope, breadth, interdependency, and temporal factors
- **Strategy Integration**: Provide threshold-based deployment recommendations for orchestration
- **Statistical Validation**: Include confidence intervals and uncertainty measures in assessments

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Parameter Collection and Validation
Update TodoWrite: Mark "complexity parameter collection" as in_progress

Execute comprehensive parameter collection using Task:
- Collect scope assessment (implementation breadth: 0-10 scale)
- Gather breadth evaluation (functional coverage: 0-10 scale)  
- Assess interdependency complexity (system coupling: 0-10 scale)
- Evaluate temporal factors (timeline constraints: 0-10 scale)

Use Bash for parameter validation with 4-decimal precision setup:
```bash
# Parameter validation with mathematical precision
for param in scope breadth interdep temporal; do
    if ! [[ "${!param}" =~ ^[0-9]+\.?[0-9]*$ ]] || (( $(echo "${!param} < 0 || ${!param} > 10" | bc -l) )); then
        echo "Error: $param must be numeric 0-10, got: ${!param}"
        exit 1
    fi
done
```

### Phase 2: Mathematical Complexity Calculation
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "mathematical complexity calculation" as in_progress

Execute precision complexity calculation using Bash:
- Apply enhanced complexity formula with temporal weighting
- Calculate base complexity using scope, breadth, interdependency
- Apply temporal adjustment factor for deadline pressure
- Validate calculation precision and boundary conditions

Use Bash for mathematical assessment:
```bash
# Enhanced complexity calculation with temporal weighting
base_complexity=$(echo "scale=4; ($scope + $breadth + $interdep) / 3" | bc)
temporal_weight=$(echo "scale=4; 1 + ($temporal * 0.15)" | bc)
complexity=$(echo "scale=4; $base_complexity * $temporal_weight" | bc)

# Boundary validation ensuring 0.0000-10.0000 range
if (( $(echo "$complexity > 10.0000" | bc -l) )); then
    complexity="10.0000"
fi
```

### Phase 3: Statistical Analysis and Confidence Assessment
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "statistical confidence analysis" as in_progress

Execute statistical validation using Task and Bash:
- Calculate assessment confidence intervals based on parameter variance
- Determine uncertainty measures from assessment methodology
- Analyze complexity distribution patterns across parameters
- Generate statistical significance measures for complexity score

Use Bash for confidence interval calculation:
```bash
# Statistical confidence assessment
param_variance=$(echo "scale=4; (($scope - $base_complexity)^2 + ($breadth - $base_complexity)^2 + ($interdep - $base_complexity)^2) / 3" | bc)
confidence_interval=$(echo "scale=4; sqrt($param_variance) * 1.96" | bc)
uncertainty_factor=$(echo "scale=4; $confidence_interval / $complexity * 100" | bc)
```

### Phase 4: Strategy Determination and Recommendations
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "deployment strategy determination" as in_progress

Execute strategy classification using standardized thresholds:
- Determine deployment strategy based on complexity thresholds
- Calculate recommended agent allocation for parallel execution
- Assess resource requirements based on complexity analysis
- Generate optimization recommendations with mathematical backing

Use Bash for strategy determination:
```bash
# Threshold-based strategy classification
if (( $(echo "$complexity >= 7.5000" | bc -l) )); then
    strategy="high-parallel"
    agent_count="8-12"
    risk_level="high"
elif (( $(echo "$complexity >= 5.0000" | bc -l) )); then
    strategy="parallel"
    agent_count="4-7"
    risk_level="medium"
elif (( $(echo "$complexity >= 2.5000" | bc -l) )); then
    strategy="sequential"
    agent_count="2-3"
    risk_level="low"
else
    strategy="single"
    agent_count="1"
    risk_level="minimal"
fi
```

### Phase 5: Report Generation and Documentation
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "complexity assessment reporting" as in_progress

Generate comprehensive complexity assessment using Write and Task:
- Document mathematical complexity score with precision validation
- Report deployment strategy with threshold rationale and agent recommendations
- Include statistical confidence measures and uncertainty analysis
- Provide optimization recommendations based on complexity breakdown

Use Write for standardized complexity report generation with mathematical precision validation.

Update TodoWrite: Complete all complexity quantification tasks

**Error Handling**: Validate parameter ranges with boundary correction, estimate missing parameters using statistical defaults, handle calculation overflow with maximum bounds, provide fallback complexity assessment using simplified models
