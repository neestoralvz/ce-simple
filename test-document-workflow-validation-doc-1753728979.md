## User Voice Original
> "Validation test for workflow auto-chaining"

## Document Purpose
This test document validates the workflow auto-chaining mechanism in the document creation process. It serves as a validation artifact to ensure:

- Content Specialist subagent deployment works correctly
- Workflow state management functions properly  
- Auto-chaining to align-doc step triggers automatically
- Context preservation between workflow steps

## Content Structure
- **Type**: test-document
- **Purpose**: Workflow validation
- **Auto-chain target**: /align-doc
- **Expected flow**: CREATE → Align → Verify

## Validation Checkpoints
1. ✅ Subagent deployed via Task tool (no direct creation)
2. ✅ User voice preserved in quotes  
3. ✅ Context metadata complete
4. ✅ Workflow state initialized
5. ⏳ Auto-chain to align-doc (pending)
6. ⏳ Final verification step (pending)
