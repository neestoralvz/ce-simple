- **System**: Multi-Subagent Intelligence Dispatcher
- **Command**: `/session-close` (system-initiated)
- **Context**: Automated session closure following research-first protocol

## Complete Conversation Transcript

### System Command Initiation
```
<command-message>session-close is running…</command-message>
<command-name>/session-close</command-name>
```

### Multi-Subagent Analysis Deployment

**Research-First Protocol Executed:**
- Timestamp extraction: `2025-07-28_13-34`
- Four specialized subagents deployed concurrently
- Comprehensive conversation analysis completed

**Analysis Results:**

#### Research Specialist Analysis
- **Theme**: Session close workflow execution using `/session-close` command
- **Category**: System workflow execution / Session management  
- **Commands Detected**: `/session-close` (explicit system invocation)
- **Evolution**: Simple command execution → systematic workflow deployment

#### Architecture Validator Analysis  
- **Decisions Made**: System properly invoked command following research-first protocol
- **Command Changes**: None required - existing workflow executed as designed
- **Architecture Impact**: Standard workflow execution with no structural changes
- **Compliance**: Full adherence to multi-subagent architecture

#### Voice Preservation Analysis
- **User Voice**: No direct user statements (system-initiated execution)
- **System Context**: Command invocation through system message protocol
- **Commitments**: System commitment to execute full session close workflow
- **Intent**: Automated session closure following established protocols

#### Content Optimizer Analysis
- **Command Requirements**: None - standard workflow execution
- **Modifications**: No changes to existing commands detected
- **Implementation**: Standard workflow with existing architecture
- **System Impact**: Following established patterns from CLAUDE.md
