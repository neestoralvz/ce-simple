# Validate Recursive - 5-Retry Validation System

## Purpose
Intelligent recursive validation system with progressive error recovery, learning capture, and systematic quality assurance. Implements 5-retry limit with escalating intervention strategies.

## Principles and Guidelines
- **Progressive Recovery**: Each retry applies increasingly sophisticated error correction
- **Learning Integration**: Capture patterns from failures to improve future validation
- **PTS Compliance**: All validation against 12-component Pragmatic Technical Simplicity framework
- **Escalation Strategy**: Clear progression from automated fixes to user intervention

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Initial Validation Assessment
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "Execute comprehensive PTS 12-component validation", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "validate-pts-1"},
  {"content": "Identify all validation failures with severity classification", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "validate-assess-1"},
  {"content": "Generate retry strategy based on failure types and complexity", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "validate-strategy-1"}
])
```

### Phase 2: Retry Loop Implementation (Attempts 1-5)
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "Execute Retry 1: Automated correction of obvious issues", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "validate-retry1-1"},
  {"content": "Execute Retry 2: Pattern-based fixes using known solutions", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "validate-retry2-1"},

  {"content": "Execute Retry 5: User escalation with detailed diagnostics", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "validate-retry5-1"}
])
```

### Phase 3: Learning and Pattern Capture
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "Analyze retry patterns and capture successful fix strategies", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "validate-learn-1"},
  {"content": "Update validation rule base with new error patterns", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "validate-update-1"},
  {"content": "Generate validation report with success metrics and learnings", "status": "pending", "priority": "low", "id": "validate-report-1"}
])
```

## Retry Strategy Framework

### Retry 1: Automated Quick Fixes
**Scope**: Obvious syntax errors, formatting issues, simple violations
**Strategy**: Direct correction using established patterns
**Examples**:
- Fix broken links and file references
- Correct formatting inconsistencies
- Update outdated syntax
- Repair simple PTS violations

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Automated fixes that can be applied safely
fixes = {
  "broken_links": "verify_and_update_references",
  "formatting": "apply_standard_formatting",
  "syntax_errors": "correct_obvious_syntax",
  "pts_simple": "apply_pts_quick_fixes"
}
```

### Retry 2: Pattern-Based Correction
**Scope**: Known error patterns with established solutions
**Strategy**: Apply proven fix patterns from knowledge base
**Examples**:
- Authority hierarchy conflicts
- Structure organization issues
- Documentation consistency problems
- Common anti-pattern detection

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Pattern matching and known solution application
patterns = {
  "authority_conflict": "establish_clear_hierarchy",
  "structure_violation": "apply_standard_organization", 
  "consistency_issue": "harmonize_similar_components",
  "pts_complex": "apply_pts_pattern_fixes"
}
```

### Retry 3: Structural Reorganization
**Scope**: Deeper architectural issues requiring restructuring
**Strategy**: Reorganize content while preserving core functionality
**Examples**:
- Directory restructuring
- Content consolidation
- Interface clarification
- Modularity improvements

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Structural changes requiring careful analysis
restructuring = {
  "directory_org": "optimize_directory_structure",
  "content_flow": "improve_information_architecture",
  "module_design": "enhance_modular_organization",
  "interface_design": "clarify_component_interfaces"
}
```

### Retry 4: Context-Aware Intelligent Reconstruction
**Scope**: Complex issues requiring deep understanding and creative solutions
**Strategy**: Rebuild components using full context understanding
**Examples**:
- Rewrite unclear documentation
- Redesign flawed architectures
- Resolve complex dependencies
- Create missing components

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Intelligent reconstruction based on context
reconstruction = {
  "documentation_rewrite": "create_clear_documentation",
  "architecture_redesign": "design_optimal_architecture",
  "dependency_resolution": "resolve_complex_dependencies",
  "component_creation": "build_missing_components"
}
```

### Retry 5: User Escalation with Diagnostics
**Scope**: Issues requiring user input, clarification, or policy decisions
**Strategy**: Provide comprehensive diagnostics and escalate to user
**Examples**:
- Ambiguous requirements
- Policy conflicts
- Resource limitations
- Design preference decisions

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Escalation with full diagnostic context
escalation = {
  "requirement_clarification": "request_user_specification",
  "policy_resolution": "escalate_policy_conflicts",
  "resource_constraints": "identify_resource_needs",
  "design_decisions": "present_options_for_user_choice"
}
```

## Validation Criteria Matrix

### PTS Component Validation
Each retry validates against all 12 PTS components:

**Technical Cluster**:
- **Directness**: Path optimization and flow simplification
- **Precision**: Accuracy verification and specificity enhancement
- **Sufficiency**: Completeness check and bloat elimination
- **Technical Excellence**: Quality assurance and best practice application

**Communication Cluster**:
- **Exactitude**: Implementation point precision
- **Sobriety**: Professional tone and marketing language elimination
- **Structure**: Logical organization and pattern consistency
- **Conciseness**: Information density optimization

**Cognitive Cluster**:
- **Clarity**: Comprehension testing and ambiguity removal
- **Coherence**: Internal consistency verification
- **Effectiveness**: Success metrics validation
- **Pragmatism**: Real-world functionality confirmation

### Severity Classification
- **Blocking**: Must fix before proceeding (security, corruption, total failure)
- **Critical**: Significantly impacts functionality or quality
- **Important**: Reduces effectiveness but doesn't break functionality
- **Minor**: Optimization opportunity with low impact

### Success Thresholds
- **Perfect**: 12/12 PTS components pass
- **Acceptable**: ≥10/12 PTS components pass, no blocking issues
- **Marginal**: ≥8/12 PTS components pass, escalation recommended
- **Failure**: <8/12 PTS components pass, user intervention required

## Learning and Adaptation System

### Pattern Recognition
```json
{
  "error_pattern": {
    "description": "Brief description of error type",
    "frequency": "How often this error occurs",
    "contexts": ["Context where error typically appears"],
    "successful_fixes": ["Strategies that worked"],
    "failed_attempts": ["Approaches that didn't work"],
    "best_retry_level": "Which retry level typically succeeds"
  }
}
```

### Knowledge Base Updates
- **Error Catalog**: Maintain database of known errors and solutions
- **Fix Effectiveness**: Track success rates of different fix strategies
- **Context Patterns**: Identify situations where certain errors are common
- **Prevention Strategies**: Develop proactive measures to avoid known issues

### Performance Optimization
- **Retry Order**: Optimize retry sequence based on success patterns
- **Fix Prioritization**: Focus on high-impact, low-effort fixes first
- **Resource Allocation**: Distribute effort based on success probability
- **Early Termination**: Skip retries when success probability is low

## Error Recovery Protocols

### Retry Failure Handling
- **State Preservation**: Save intermediate states after each retry
- **Rollback Capability**: Return to last known good state
- **Incremental Progress**: Apply partial fixes when complete solution fails
- **Alternative Approaches**: Try different strategies when primary approach fails

### Escalation Criteria
- **Complexity Threshold**: Escalate when issue complexity exceeds capability
- **Resource Limits**: Escalate when solution requires unavailable resources
- **Policy Decisions**: Escalate when business or design decisions needed
- **Time Constraints**: Escalate when retry limit reached

### User Communication
- **Clear Diagnostics**: Provide detailed analysis of what failed and why
- **Solution Options**: Present alternative approaches for user consideration
- **Impact Assessment**: Explain consequences of different choices
- **Next Steps**: Clear guidance on how to proceed

## Success Metrics

### Validation Effectiveness
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of validations that ultimately pass
- **Retry Efficiency**: Average number of retries needed for success
- **Error Resolution**: Percentage of errors resolved automatically
- **User Escalation Rate**: Frequency of escalation to user intervention

### Learning System Performance
- **Pattern Recognition**: Accuracy of error pattern identification
- **Fix Prediction**: Success rate of predicted fix strategies
- **Knowledge Growth**: Rate of new pattern discovery and integration
- **Prevention Effectiveness**: Reduction in repeat error occurrences

### System Integration
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamless operation within larger workflows
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal overhead on normal operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when validation fails
- **Documentation Quality**: Clear reporting of validation results
