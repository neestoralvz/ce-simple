# CLAUDE.md - Simplified Commands System

**Last Updated: 2025-07-22**

## ðŸŽ¯ SYSTEM OVERVIEW

**ce-simple** is a streamlined command system for Claude Code that enables efficient context engineering through intelligent workflow orchestration and agent deployment.

### Core Philosophy
- **Pragmatic Effectiveness**: Practical results over theoretical perfection
- **Autocontained Commands**: Complete functionality within command network
- **LLM Optimized**: All documentation designed for Claude Code consumption
- **Anti-Bias Processing**: Evidence-based discovery without assumptions

## ðŸš€ COMMAND DIRECTORY

### Commands Location: `.claude/commands/`

### Master Workflow
- **`/start`** - Discovery workflow master with dynamic questioning and agent orchestration

### Core Operations  
- **`/explore-codebase`** - Internal knowledge discovery with parallel Task Tool deployment
- **`/explore-web`** - External research and pattern validation with parallel WebSearch
- **`/think-layers`** - Progressive analysis: think â†’ think-hard â†’ think-harder â†’ ultra-think
- **`/capture-learnings`** - Intelligent pattern detection and post-execution learning with dynamic interviews

### System Standards
All commands located in `.claude/commands/` and follow integrated standards for:
- LLM-optimized writing and structure (see `standards/writing-standards.md`)
- Real-time workflow notifications and progress tracking (see `standards/workflow-notifications.md`)
- Anti-bias protocols for neutral information processing (see `standards/anti-bias-rules.md`)
- Standardized command structure with cross-reference integration (see `standards/command-template.md`)
- **Date-based maintenance**: CLAUDE.md MUST include "Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD" for temporal context

## ðŸŽ¯ ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES

### Simplicity First Framework
Core architectural principles for maintaining system simplicity (see `standards/simplicity-principles.md` for detailed implementation):
- **Transparency â‰  Verbosity**: One-line reasoning > paragraph explanations
- **Coordination â‰  Documentation**: Commands execute workflows, don't educate concepts
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex details â†’ referenced files, not inline expansion
- **Function over Form**: Execution value prioritized over explanation value

### Architectural Boundaries
- **Commands**: Workflow coordination and agent orchestration only
- **Standards**: Detailed frameworks, criteria, and implementation guidelines
- **Context**: Learning patterns, discoveries, and architectural decisions

## ðŸ”§ WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

### Primary Discovery Flow
```
âŸ³ /start â†’ dynamic questions â†’ /explore-codebase + /explore-web â†’ /think-layers â†’ execution plan â†’ /capture-learnings
```

### Agent Orchestration
- **Parallel Deployment**: Multiple Task Tools and WebSearch operations simultaneously
- **Cognitive Load Management**: Automatic workload distribution across agent instances
- **Progress Notifications**: Real-time updates through standardized notification system
- **Context Integration**: Seamless handoff between exploration, analysis, and planning

### Context Generation
- **Anti-Fragmentation**: Consolidated documentation in structured context directories
- **Cross-Reference Network**: Commands interconnected through execution references
- **Evidence-Based**: All findings supported by discovered evidence
- **Maximum Density**: Optimized information value per cognitive unit
- **Temporal Context**: Date-based maintenance enables accurate discovery and exploration references

## ðŸ“‹ EXECUTION PROTOCOLS

### Auto-Activation Framework
- **Complexity Detection**: Automatic workflow depth determination
- **Context Sufficiency**: Dynamic assessment of information completeness  
- **Exploration Triggers**: Intelligent deployment of research and analysis agents
- **Load Balancing**: Optimal cognitive resource distribution

### Quality Assurance
- **Progressive Validation**: Multi-layer verification across thinking stages
- **Cross-Command Integration**: Seamless workflow continuity
- **Success Metrics**: Quantifiable completion and quality indicators
- **Error Recovery**: Robust fallback and correction mechanisms

## ðŸŽ¯ IMPLEMENTATION READY

### System Status
- âœ“ **Command Structure**: Core commands implemented and cross-referenced
- âœ“ **Standards Framework**: Writing, notification, and anti-bias protocols established
- âœ“ **Workflow Integration**: Discovery-to-execution pipeline operational
- âœ“ **Context Architecture**: Structured documentation and pattern storage

### Usage Instructions
1. **Initialize**: Execute `/start` with initial request or problem statement
2. **Respond**: Answer dynamic discovery questions for context clarification
3. **Monitor**: Track progress through real-time notification system
4. **Review**: Evaluate generated context and analysis results
5. **Execute**: Implement recommendations from completed workflow
