# CLAUDE.md - VDD Reset

**Updated**: 2025-07-26 | **Authority**: user-input/ (Sacred User Space) | **Status**: Clean reset from simulation

## Section 1: User Vision Authority
@user-input/vision/core-mission-concept.md - Core mission and philosophy
@user-input/technical-requirements/technical-architecture-user.md - Real technical requirements
@user-input/technical-requirements/think-by-four-mandatory.md - Think×4 perpetual analysis requirement
See [user-input/README.md](user-input/README.md) for Sacred User Space authority

## Section 2: Real Implementation
**Commands** → [.claude/commands/](.claude/commands/) - Self-contained Task Tool commands with individual sub-agent reporting (explore-codebase, init-project, start, docs-audit)
**Export Commands** → [export/commands/](export/commands/) - Full command library (86 commands in 15 categories)
**Core Authority** → [docs/core/](docs/core/) - Organized 6-layer technical authority with Think×4 integration:
  - **01-fnd-foundations/** - PTS framework with Think×4, development principles, partnership protocol, system principles
  - **02-std-standards/** - Command governance with Think×4, patterns, tier matrix, development standards  
  - **03-com-communication/** - Documentation standards, communication rules, context management, markdown compliance
  - **04-pro-protocols/** - Task orchestration with Think×4, Git workflow, tool usage, parallel execution
  - **05-per-performance/** - Performance framework, context economy, compaction techniques, progressive disclosure
  - **06-inf-infrastructure/** - Project structure, command index, navigation system, environment, VDD dashboard
**System Knowledge** → [docs/context/](docs/context/) - Learned patterns, examples, implementation wisdom
**Strategic Direction** → [docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/) - Vision and architectural governance
**Development Tools** → [tools/](tools/) - Templates and utilities for development
**Rules System** → [rules/](rules/) - Conditional loading protocols and modular rule architecture
@rules/conditional-loading-protocols.md - Context-based rule activation protocols

## Section 3: Core Principles (from user-input/)
**Think×4 Methodology**: Mandatory cognitive framework (Think → Think Hard → Think Harder → Ultra Think) for all decisions
**Task Tool Parallelization**: Real parallel execution (8-16 searches, 5-10 files, 4-8 analysis)
**Self-Contained Commands**: All logic embedded inline (sub-agents can't access external files)
**Git-Based Intelligence**: Real Git metrics and WorkTrees for parallel development
**PTS Framework**: 12-component validation (not simulated)

## Section 4: Implementation Truth
- **Real Task Tool**: Uses Claude Code's actual Task Tool with parallel sub-agents
- **No Sub-Agent Architecture**: No simulated coordination protocols
- **Honest Performance**: Real parallelization gains, not projected metrics
- **Simple & Functional**: 4 core commands that actually work

## Tech Stack
- **Platform**: Claude Code with real Task Tool | **Commands**: Self-contained with embedded logic
- **Authority**: user-input/ → CLAUDE_RULES → docs/core/ → .claude/commands/ → implementation | **Truth**: Real functionality only

**Reset Truth**: Clean system based on actual user vision, eliminating architectural simulation
