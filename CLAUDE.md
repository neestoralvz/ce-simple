# CLAUDE.md - Simplified Commands System

**Last Updated: 2025-07-22**

## ðŸŽ¯ SYSTEM OVERVIEW

**ce-simple**: Streamlined command system for Claude Code enabling efficient context engineering through intelligent workflow orchestration and agent deployment.

**Core Philosophy**: Pragmatic effectiveness, autocontained commands, LLM optimized, anti-bias processing â†’ `docs/system/architectural-principles.md`

**Meticulous Protocol**: Exhaustive verification when "meticulosamente" specified â†’ `docs/quality/meticulous-verification-protocol.md`

**File Management Rules**: All file creation restrictions and maintenance rules â†’ `docs/quality/anti-bias-rules.md`

## ðŸš€ COMMAND DIRECTORY

### Commands Location: `.claude/commands/`

### Master Workflow
- **`/start`** - Discovery workflow with dynamic questioning and agent orchestration
- **Automation Tools** - Git WorkTrees, monitoring, and performance tracking (`tools/`)

### Core Operations  
- **`/explore-codebase`** - Internal knowledge discovery with parallel Task Tool deployment
- **`/explore-web`** - External research and pattern validation with parallel WebSearch
- **`/think-layers`** - Progressive analysis: think â†’ think-hard â†’ think-harder â†’ ultra-think
- **`/capture-learnings`** - Pattern detection and post-execution learning with dynamic interviews

### System Maintenance
- **`/matrix-maintenance`** - Cross-reference matrix validation and system integrity monitoring

### System Standards
Commands follow integrated standards â†’ `docs/documentation/writing-standards.md`, `docs/workflow/workflow-notifications.md`, `docs/quality/anti-bias-rules.md`, `docs/command/command-template.md`

## ðŸ”§ WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

### Primary Discovery Flow
```
âŸ³ /start â†’ dynamic questions â†’ /explore-codebase + /explore-web â†’ /think-layers â†’ execution plan â†’ /capture-learnings
â”œâ”€ /matrix-maintenance â†’ Cross-reference validation (periodic)
```

**Complete workflow details**: `docs/workflow/primary-discovery-flow.md`

### Intelligence Parallelization Protocol
**MANDATORY**: Autocontained analysis â†’ optimization â†’ aggressive execution
- **Dynamic WebSearches** (4-16 based on topic complexity)
- **Adaptive codebase operations** (12-52 based on project size)
- **Message-level optimization** - maximize efficiency through intelligent batching

**Detailed specifications**: `docs/implementation/aggressive-parallelization-protocol.md`

## ðŸŽ¯ IMPLEMENTATION READY

### System Status
- âœ“ **Command Structure**: Core commands implemented and cross-referenced
- âœ“ **Standards Framework**: Writing, notification, and anti-bias protocols established
- âœ“ **Workflow Integration**: Discovery-to-execution pipeline operational
- âœ“ **Context Architecture**: Organized subdirectories (discoveries/, patterns/, research/, workflows/) with intelligent file creation controls

### Usage Instructions
1. **Initialize**: Execute `/start` with initial request
2. **Respond**: Answer dynamic discovery questions for context clarification
3. **Monitor**: Track progress through real-time notifications
4. **Review**: Evaluate generated context and analysis results
5. **Execute**: Implement recommendations from workflow

**Complete operation guide**: `docs/system/usage-instructions.md`

**CRITICAL**: This system operates through slash command execution only. All functionality accessed via `/command-name` with autocontained cross-command integration.
