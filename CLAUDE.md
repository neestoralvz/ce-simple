# CLAUDE.md - Simplified Commands System

**Last Updated: 2025-07-22**

## ðŸŽ¯ SYSTEM OVERVIEW

**ce-simple**: Streamlined command system for Claude Code enabling efficient context engineering through intelligent workflow orchestration and agent deployment.

### Core Philosophy
- **Pragmatic Effectiveness**: Practical results over theoretical perfection
- **Autocontained Commands**: Complete functionality within command network
- **LLM Optimized**: Documentation designed for Claude Code consumption
- **Anti-Bias Processing**: Evidence-based discovery without assumptions

## ðŸš€ COMMAND DIRECTORY

### Commands Location: `.claude/commands/`

### Master Workflow
- **`/start`** - Discovery workflow with dynamic questioning and agent orchestration
- **Automation Tools** - Git WorkTrees, monitoring, and performance tracking (`tools/`)

### Core Operations  
- **`/explore-codebase`** - Internal knowledge discovery with parallel Task Tool deployment
- **`/explore-web`** - External research and pattern validation with parallel WebSearch
- **`/think-layers`** - Progressive analysis: think â†’ think-hard â†’ think-harder â†’ ultra-think
- **`/capture-learnings`** - Pattern detection and post-execution learning with dynamic interviews

### System Maintenance
- **`/matrix-maintenance`** - Cross-reference matrix validation and system integrity monitoring

### System Standards
Commands in `.claude/commands/` follow integrated standards:
- LLM-optimized writing and structure (`docs/documentation/writing-standards.md`)
- Real-time workflow notifications (`docs/workflow/workflow-notifications.md`)
- Anti-bias protocols (`docs/quality/anti-bias-rules.md`)
- Standardized command structure (`docs/command/command-template.md`)
- **Date-based maintenance**: CLAUDE.md includes "Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD" for temporal context

## ðŸŽ¯ ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES

### Intelligent Parallelization Protocol
**MANDATORY**: Autocontained analysis â†’ optimization â†’ aggressive execution
- **Dynamic WebSearches** (4-16 based on topic complexity) with embedded intelligence
- **Adaptive codebase operations** (12-52 based on project size) with automatic scaling
- **Analyze-first mindset** - assess context before executing parallelization
- **Message-level optimization** - maximize efficiency through intelligent batching

### Simplicity First Framework
Core principles for system simplicity (`docs/documentation/simplicity-principles.md`):
- **Transparency â‰  Verbosity**: One-line reasoning > paragraph explanations
- **Coordination â‰  Documentation**: Commands execute workflows, don't educate concepts
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex details â†’ referenced files, not inline expansion
- **Function over Form**: Execution value prioritized over explanation value

### Architectural Boundaries
- **Commands**: Workflow coordination and agent orchestration only
- **Standards**: Detailed frameworks, criteria, and implementation guidelines
- **Context**: Learning patterns, discoveries, and architectural decisions

## ðŸ”§ WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

### Primary Discovery Flow
```
âŸ³ /start â†’ dynamic questions â†’ /explore-codebase + /explore-web â†’ /think-layers â†’ execution plan â†’ /capture-learnings
â”œâ”€ /matrix-maintenance â†’ Cross-reference validation (periodic)
```

### Agent Orchestration
- **Parallel Deployment**: Multiple Task Tools and WebSearch operations simultaneously
- **Cognitive Load Management**: Automatic workload distribution across agent instances
- **Progress Notifications**: Real-time updates through standardized notifications
- **Context Integration**: Seamless handoff between exploration, analysis, and planning

### Context Generation
- **Anti-Fragmentation**: Consolidated documentation in structured context directories
- **Cross-Reference Network**: Commands interconnected through execution references with matrix validation
- **Evidence-Based**: All findings supported by discovered evidence
- **Maximum Density**: Optimized information value per cognitive unit
- **Matrix Integrity**: Automated cross-reference validation via `/matrix-maintenance`
- **Temporal Context**: Date-based maintenance enables accurate discovery and exploration references

## ðŸ“‹ EXECUTION PROTOCOLS

### Auto-Activation Framework
- **Complexity Detection**: Automatic workflow depth determination
- **Context Sufficiency**: Dynamic assessment of information completeness
- **Exploration Triggers**: Intelligent deployment of research and analysis agents
- **Load Balancing**: Optimal cognitive resource distribution

### Quality Assurance
- **Progressive Validation**: Multi-layer verification across thinking stages
- **Cross-Command Integration**: Seamless workflow continuity
- **Success Metrics**: Quantifiable completion and quality indicators
- **Error Recovery**: Robust fallback and correction mechanisms

## ðŸŽ¯ IMPLEMENTATION READY

### System Status
- âœ“ **Command Structure**: Core commands implemented and cross-referenced
- âœ“ **Standards Framework**: Writing, notification, and anti-bias protocols established
- âœ“ **Workflow Integration**: Discovery-to-execution pipeline operational
- âœ“ **Context Architecture**: Structured documentation and pattern storage

### Usage Instructions
1. **Initialize**: Execute `/start` with initial request
2. **Respond**: Answer dynamic discovery questions for context clarification
3. **Monitor**: Track progress through real-time notifications
4. **Review**: Evaluate generated context and analysis results
5. **Execute**: Implement recommendations from workflow
