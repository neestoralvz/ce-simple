## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
placement-methodology/README.md → authority-placement-logic.md implements authority-based placement per methodology authority

## AUTHORITY-BASED PLACEMENT LOGIC FRAMEWORK

### **Authority-Driven Placement Decisions**
```
Authority-Based Placement Protocol:
├── User Authority Content Placement
│   ├── Placement Target: context/vision/ or @context/architecture/core/authority.md
│   ├── Validation Requirement: Direct user vision alignment verification
│   ├── Preservation Standard: Complete user voice preservation required
│   ├── Integration Protocol: Supreme authority chain maintenance
│   └── Quality Gate: User authority supremacy compliance validation
├── System Authority Content Placement
│   ├── Placement Target: @context/architecture/core/methodology.md or specialized modules
│   ├── Validation Requirement: System authority boundary compliance
│   ├── Preservation Standard: Technical accuracy and consistency
│   ├── Integration Protocol: User authority supremacy preservation
│   └── Quality Gate: Methodology framework alignment validation
├── Shared Authority Content Placement
│   ├── Placement Target: Reference architecture with bidirectional links
│   ├── Validation Requirement: Both user and system authority compliance
│   ├── Preservation Standard: Authority balance and boundary respect
│   ├── Integration Protocol: Authority conflict prevention protocols
│   └── Quality Gate: Authority integration effectiveness validation
└── Authority Conflict Content Placement
    ├── Placement Target: Temporary placement with resolution planning
    ├── Validation Requirement: Authority supremacy determination required
    ├── Preservation Standard: User authority supremacy enforcement
    ├── Integration Protocol: Authority chain repair and reconstruction
    └── Quality Gate: Authority conflict resolution validation
```

### **Authority-Based Integration Protocols**
```
Authority Integration Framework:
├── User Authority Integration
│   ├── Supreme Authority Preservation: User authority overrides all
│   ├── Vision-Driven Integration: Integration serves user vision
│   ├── Authority Supremacy Maintenance: User authority supremacy throughout
│   └── User Voice Fidelity: ≥95% user voice preservation requirement
├── System Authority Integration
│   ├── Boundary Compliance: System authority within user boundaries
│   ├── Technical Accuracy: System authority serves technical correctness
│   ├── Efficiency Optimization: System authority improves efficiency
│   └── User Authority Supremacy: System authority never overrides user
├── Shared Authority Integration
│   ├── Collaborative Authority: User vision + system implementation
│   ├── Boundary Respect: Clear authority boundaries maintained
│   ├── Authority Balance: Appropriate authority distribution
│   └── Conflict Prevention: Authority conflicts prevented proactively
└── Authority Conflict Integration
    ├── Conflict Identification: Authority conflicts identified quickly
    ├── Supremacy Determination: User authority supremacy enforced
    ├── Conflict Resolution: Authority conflicts resolved systematically
    └── Chain Reconstruction: Authority chain repaired after resolution
```

### **Authority Validation Integration Protocol**
```
Authority Validation Integration:
├── Authority Assessment Integration
│   ├── Content authority source identification and integration
│   ├── Authority level determination and integration planning
│   ├── Authority boundary analysis and integration design
│   └── Authority conflict detection and integration adjustments
├── Authority Compliance Integration
│   ├── User authority supremacy compliance check and integration
│   ├── Authority chain integrity verification and integration
│   ├── Authority preservation requirement assessment and integration
│   └── Authority contamination prevention validation and integration
├── Authority Decision Integration
│   ├── Placement recommendation based on authority analysis
│   ├── Integration pathway determination through authority validation
│   ├── Quality gate requirement specification based on authority
│   └── Authority preservation protocol activation and integration
└── Authority Documentation Integration
    ├── Authority source documentation and integration records
    ├── Authority decision rationale recording and integration
    ├── Authority preservation plan specification and integration
    └── Authority validation checkpoint establishment and integration
```
