## AUTHORITY SOURCE VALIDATION FRAMEWORK

### **Authority Source Categories**
```
Authority Source Classification:
├── User Authority Validation
│   ├── Direct user statements or instructions
│   ├── User vision or philosophy expressions
│   ├── User preference or requirement definitions
│   └── User authority supremacy enforcement requirements
├── System Authority Validation
│   ├── Technical implementation authority
│   ├── Process optimization authority
│   ├── Standards enforcement authority
│   └── System evolution authority
├── Shared Authority Validation
│   ├── User-system collaborative content
│   ├── Implementation guided by user vision
│   ├── System optimization within user boundaries
│   └── Reference architecture for shared content
└── Authority Conflict Resolution
    ├── Authority conflict identification
    ├── Authority supremacy determination
    ├── Conflict resolution protocol activation
    └── Authority chain reconstruction if needed
```

### **Authority Source Identification Protocol**
```
Source Identification Process:
├── Content Origin Analysis
│   ├── Content source: User statement vs system generation vs hybrid
│   ├── Authority lineage: Trace content to original authority source
│   ├── Authority evolution: Track authority changes over time
│   └── Authority contamination: Identify authority drift or dilution
├── Authority Language Analysis
│   ├── Direct authority statements: "I want", "Must be", "Required"
│   ├── Vision language: Philosophy, principles, system behavior expectations
│   ├── Delegation language: System authority within user boundaries
│   └── Conflict language: Authority ambiguity or competing claims
├── Authority Strength Assessment
│   ├── Supreme authority: Overrides all other considerations
│   ├── Primary authority: Major influence on system behavior
│   ├── Secondary authority: Supporting or implementing authority
│   └── Delegated authority: System authority within user-defined boundaries
└── Authority Validation Requirements
    ├── User voice fidelity: ≥95% preservation requirement
    ├── Authority chain integrity: Complete traceability required
    ├── Authority contamination prevention: Clean authority sources
    └── Authority supremacy preservation: User authority overrides all
```

### **Authority Source Documentation Protocol**
```
Authority Documentation Framework:
├── Authority Source Documentation
│   ├── Authority origin: Where did this authority come from?
│   ├── Authority context: What circumstances established this authority?
│   ├── Authority scope: What does this authority cover?
│   └── Authority evolution: How has this authority changed?
├── Authority Validation Documentation
│   ├── Validation method: How was authority source validated?
│   ├── Validation evidence: What evidence supports authority claim?
│   ├── Validation confidence: How certain is authority identification?
│   └── Validation date: When was authority source last validated?
└── Authority Preservation Documentation
    ├── Preservation requirements: What must be preserved?
    ├── Preservation mechanisms: How is authority preserved?
    ├── Preservation validation: How is preservation verified?
    └── Preservation monitoring: How is ongoing preservation ensured?
```
