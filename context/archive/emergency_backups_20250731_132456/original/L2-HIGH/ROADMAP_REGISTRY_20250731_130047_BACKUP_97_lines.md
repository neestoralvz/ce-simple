## 📊 SUMMARY

### 🚀 Work Items Status
- **Completed**: 11 handoffs + 2 phases = **13/35 items (37%)**
- **Active**: 3 items in progress (P0B-CLEANUP 73%, PC-PARALLEL 53%, H6A-QUICK-WINS 84%)
- **Ready**: 10 items ready for execution
- **Blocked**: 18 items waiting for dependencies

### 🎫 Issues Status  
- **Critical Blocked**: 7 issues waiting for P0B completion
- **Independent Ready**: 8 issues can work parallel anytime
- **Violations**: 164 remaining (44% progress from ~294 baseline)

### 🔧 Core Factorization Initiative
**9 H-handoffs**: /core command modularization (103 lines → dispatcher + 6 subcomandos)
**Phase 1 Ready**: H-SCRIPTS-INV + H-CORE-ANALYSIS (parallel execution)
**Benefits**: Conditional loading, graceful degradation, hook integration

## 🎯 NEXT ACTIONS

### Priority 1: P0B Parallel Handoffs
Execute remaining violation cleanup handoffs to unblock 7 critical issues and P1-P7 phases

### Priority 2: Core Factorization Phase 1  
Start H-SCRIPTS-INV + H-CORE-ANALYSIS (independent of P0B bottleneck)

### Priority 3: PC-PARALLEL Continuation
Continue coordination work (53% → completion)

### Priority 4: Independent Issues
Work on 8 independent issues parallel anytime (#13, #10, #11, #19, #21, #7, #8, #9)
