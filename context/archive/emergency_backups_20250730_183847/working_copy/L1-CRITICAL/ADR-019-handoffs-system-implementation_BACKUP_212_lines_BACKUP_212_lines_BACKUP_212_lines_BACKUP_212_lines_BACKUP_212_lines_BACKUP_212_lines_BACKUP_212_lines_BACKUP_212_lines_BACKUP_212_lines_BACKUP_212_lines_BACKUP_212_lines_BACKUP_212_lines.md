# ADR-019: Handoffs System Implementation

**Status**: ✅ ACCEPTED
**Date**: 2025-07-30
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive handoffs system for task transfer and multi-session coordination
**Category**: Process & Methodology

## Context

Complex architectural remediation and multi-conversation coordination required systematic task transfer methodology. Existing ad-hoc handoff approaches created continuity breaks and authority chain confusion during multi-session execution.

### Problem Identified

**Task Transfer Challenges**:
- **Continuity Loss**: Session transitions losing context and execution momentum
- **Authority Fragmentation**: Handoff documentation failing to preserve user authority chain
- **Dependency Ambiguity**: Unclear relationships between parallel and sequential task execution
- **Execution Readiness**: Incomplete handoff documentation preventing immediate task resumption

### Strategic Requirements
**Critical System Remediation**: Multiple file size violations requiring systematic remediation across 4 phases
**Multi-Conversation Coordination**: Complex tasks requiring parallel execution with dependency management  
**Authority Preservation**: Complete user voice fidelity maintenance through multi-session workflows

## Decision

Implement **COMPREHENSIVE HANDOFFS SYSTEM** enabling seamless task transfer with complete execution readiness and authority preservation through multi-session coordination.
