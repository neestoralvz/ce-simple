Integrate multi-conversation ultra-orchestration + background intelligence architecture + phase-based transformation + quote-based fragmentation. Preserve authority chain while implementing system-wide transformation capability.",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
)
```

## Multi-Conversation Ultra-Orchestration Template

```
Task(
  description: "Ultra-orchestration coordination",
  prompt: "Act as multi-conversation ultra-orchestration specialist. Load context from context/operational/behaviors/orchestration_protocol.md and context/operational/patterns/revolutionary_methodology_integration.md.

Enable user ultra-orchestrator role while maintaining command independence.",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
)
```

## Knowledge Integration Evolution Template

```
Task(
  description: "Knowledge integration evolution",
  prompt: "Act as knowledge integration evolution specialist.

CONTEXT LOADING:
- Load: context/operational/operations/knowledge_integration_protocol.md
- Load: context/operational/patterns/conversation_architecture_transformation_cycle.md
- Apply: Think x4 methodology → Revolutionary pattern recognition → Authority preservation

ROLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Integrate conversation insights into permanent system knowledge
- Preserve user voice supremacy during system evolution
- Enable organic system advancement through discovered patterns
- Create handoff documentation for seamless continuation

INTEGRATION PROTOCOL:
1. Session insight extraction: Identify key learnings and methodologies
2. Operational integration: Update patterns and behaviors based on discoveries
3. Authority preservation: Maintain user voice supremacy throughout integration
4. Handoff preparation: Create documentation enabling effective continuation
5. Evolution validation: Ensure system advancement preserves core vision

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Session insight summary with operational integration
- Authority preservation validation
- System evolution evidence
- Handoff documentation for seamless continuation",

```

## Authority Preservation Validation Template

```
Task(
  description: "Authority preservation validation",
  prompt: "Act as authority preservation validation specialist. Load context from @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md and context/operational/patterns/authority_framework.md. Validate revolutionary methodology integration maintains user voice supremacy. Verify 95%+ user quote fidelity + authority chain compliance + user domain boundaries respected. Challenge any AI contamination or interpretation layering during integration process.",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
)
```

## Usage Integration Guidelines

### Revolutionary Methodology Deployment
- **Complex transformations** → Use Architectural Transformation Mastery Specialist
- **User authority files** → Use Quote-Based Fragmentation Specialist  
- **System evolution** → Use Revolutionary Methodology Integration Specialist
- **Parallel coordination** → Use Ultra-Orchestration Template
- **Session analysis** → Use Knowledge Integration Evolution Template

### Authority Validation Protocol
- **All revolutionary templates** DEBE include Authority Preservation Validation
- **Post-delegation validation** SIEMPRE mandatory for system-wide changes
- **User voice fidelity** verified through specialized validation template

### Template Chain Coordination
1. **Primary specialist template** → Execute revolutionary methodology
2. **Authority validation template** → Verify user voice preservation
3. **Integration completion** → Update operational patterns accordingly
