# VISION.md - Living Vision Evolution

**30/07/2025 07:50 CDMX** | Dynamic vision that evolves through conversation

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
VISION.md → drives all system evolution → everything adapts to vision

## CORE VISION PRINCIPLES

### Vision Discovery Philosophy
**"El usuario no necesita llegar con visión clara - el sistema la extrae through dialogue"**

- Vision emerges organically through conversation and iteration
- System discovers vision through questions, not assumptions
- Vision evolves through learning, investigation, and even mistakes
- Each conversation can reveal new aspects of vision or evolution needs

### Evolutionary Adaptation Protocol
**"La documentación, el contexto, los comandos deben de evolucionar con la visión"**

- Nothing in the system remains static - everything adapts to discovered vision
- Vision changes trigger system-wide evolution
- Architecture serves vision, not the reverse
- Partner constructor role evolves with vision

### Simplicity-Complexity Balance
**"No se trata de hacerlo simple o complejo, pero hacerlo lo que tiene que ser"**

- Neither simplicity nor complexity as default - correctness for vision
- Embrace complexity when vision requires it
- Prefer simplicity when vision allows it
- Function and purpose drive complexity decisions

### Natural Conversation First
**"Quiero que el sistema se sienta como una conversación natural, que de esa conversación natural salga el resultado"**

- Conversation-first approach to all interactions
- Natural dialogue reveals true user needs
- Multiple conversation techniques available (socratic, brainstorming, interviews)
- System adapts conversation style to context and user needs

## CURRENT VISION STATE

### Project Philosophy
**Context engineering framework para conversation-first development**

- System that discovers and amplifies user vision rather than imposing structure
- Technology that makes projects more human and custom-made
- Complete context before implementation - "esa es la magia"
- Bidirectional expansion: user provides fragments, system asks expanding questions

### System Behavior Expectations
**"Yo estoy para brindar mi visión, no para hacer las cosas"**

- User provides vision guidance and validation
- System executes discovery, analysis, and implementation
- System proactively maintains vision alignment through questions
- System auto-detects vision drift and proposes corrections

### Architecture Philosophy
**"Hacerlo lo que tiene que ser"**

- Structure follows discovered function, not predetermined architecture
- Clean slate reconstruction when path was wrong
- Decision-tree navigation through folder structure
- Risk management built into evolution process

## VISION EVOLUTION PROTOCOL

### Conversation-Driven Evolution
- Real-time vision updates during natural dialogue
- Semantic triggers detect potential vision evolution moments
- System proposes vision updates: "¿Esto debería cambiar tu visión?"
- User validates evolution through continued conversation

### System Adaptation Triggers
- Vision discovery conversations trigger system evolution
- Architecture adapts to serve discovered needs
- Commands evolve based on actual usage patterns
- Partner constructor role evolves with vision depth

### Chronological Vision Tracking
- Timestamped vision evolution decisions
- Decision archaeology - understanding why choices were made when
- Vision timeline showing organic growth through conversations
- Preserved context of vision evolution reasoning

## CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION NEEDS

### Essential Workflows Identified
1. **Vision Discovery Workflow** - Natural conversation that extracts/evolves vision
2. **VISION.md Evolution Workflow** - Updates vision based on discoveries
3. **System Cleanup Workflow** - Eliminates architectural bloat that doesn't serve vision
4. **Project Context Setup** - Gets projects ready for vision-driven work
5. **Implementation Workflow** - Actually builds things after vision is complete

### Structural Evolution Requirements
- Folder structure redesign based on decision-tree navigation
- Essential files only - eliminate 197-file architectural overhead
- Function-first organization - structure serves discovered purpose
- Clear pathway visibility - always know where files lead and why

### Partner Constructor Evolution
- Dynamic challenging based on current vision state
- Context-aware oversight that catches actual drift patterns
- Meta-awareness - question own assumptions and static patterns
- Vision-synchronized guidance that evolves with discoveries

## IMMUTABLE CORE vs EVOLUTIONARY ZONE

### Immutable Core (No se mueve)
- Conversation-first philosophy
- Organic evolution principle  
- User vision authority supremacy
- Natural dialogue over prescribed methods

### Evolutionary Zone (Sí se mueve)
- System architecture and file organization
- Specific implementation approaches
- Complexity level decisions
- Workflow and command structures

### Risk-Managed Evolution
- "Estos cambios en visión provocan riesgos" - acknowledged and managed
- Clean slate reconstruction when path was wrong
- Dialogue-intensive decision making for changes
- Core stability validation during evolution

**LIVING DOCUMENT DECLARATION**: This vision evolves through every conversation. Each insight, discovery, and evolution becomes part of the vision DNA that drives all system behavior.

**NEXT EVOLUTION**: System implementation of vision discovery engine + essential workflows + decision-tree navigation architecture.
