# UX Placement - Complete Placement System Authority

**31/07/2025 00:00 CDMX** | Unified placement and decision system with visual navigation

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/vision/vision_foundation.md → @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → ux-placement.md implements complete placement intelligence per conversation-first development

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Visual decision tree eliminates placement paralysis while preserving systematic accuracy"** - Every content placement follows clear pathways with authority validation, serving conversation-first development through intelligent navigation.

## VISUAL DECISION SYSTEM

### Complete 4-Phase Placement Framework
**Phase 1: Content Classification** → Domain identification and routing logic
**Phase 2: Authority Validation** → User/system authority verification protocols
**Phase 3: Placement Logic** → Scope analysis and placement decision tree
**Phase 4: Final Validation** → Quality gates and compliance verification

### Visual Decision Navigation Protocol
- **Entry Point**: Content placement need identified → Load visual decision system
- **Classification**: Domain identification through semantic pattern recognition
- **Authority Validation**: Authority source verification and conflict resolution
- **Placement Decision**: Scope and location determination with quality assurance
- **Quality Validation**: Compliance and reference verification protocols

## INTEGRATION PATHWAYS SYSTEM

### Supreme Authority Integration
**Authority Flow Validation**: All integration pathways preserve supreme user authority chain
**Vision Alignment**: Integration decisions validated against user vision foundation
**Authority Traceability**: Complete path from user authority to implementation components
**Supremacy Preservation**: User authority overrides all technical integration decisions

### Context Core Integration Matrix
**Core Context Loading**: vision_foundation.md, truth-source.md, authority.md, methodology.md, simplicity.md
**Conditional Loading**: Context components loaded based on semantic pattern recognition
**Authority Preservation**: Context integration maintains authority chain integrity
**Progressive Disclosure**: Context loading adapts to conversation depth and complexity

### Component Relationship Mapping
**Authority Relationships**: Authority → principles → methodology → patterns → standards → templates
**Navigation Intelligence**: Smart routing between related components
**Cross-Reference Validation**: Bidirectional relationship consistency maintenance
**Integration Pathways**: Clear navigation routes for conversation-first development

## INTERACTIVE PLACEMENT GUIDE SYSTEM

### Step-by-Step Placement Wizard
**Step 1: Content Analysis** → Complete content analysis through systematic classification
**Step 2: Authority Validation** → Complete authority validation through chain verification
**Step 3: Scope Determination** → Scope analysis and impact assessment protocols
**Step 4: Placement Execution** → Systematic placement with quality gate compliance
**Step 5: Integration Validation** → Integration testing and quality assurance validation

### Placement Pathway Specialization
**User Vision Pathway**: Vision/philosophy content placement process with authority preservation
**Authority Pathway**: Authority/permission content placement with supremacy validation
**Technical Pathway**: Technical implementation content with systematic quality gates
**Standards Pathway**: Standards/compliance content with enforcement integration
**Template Pathway**: Template/structure content with systematic selection framework
**Data Pathway**: Data/metrics content with validation and performance integration

## RAPID DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM

### Instant Placement Matrix
| Content Type | Authority | Location | Integration |
|--------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **User Vision** | User | context/vision/ | → All affected components |
| **Authority Rules** | User | core/authority.md | ← All authority-dependent |
| **Technical Patterns** | System | patterns.md | ← Implementation users |
| **Standards/Rules** | System | standards.md | → Specialized modules |
| **Templates** | System | templates.md | ← Template users |
| **Data/Metrics** | System | context/data/ | ← Data consumers |

### Semantic Trigger Classification
**User Vision Keywords**: "vision", "philosophy", "user wants", "vision discovery" → context/vision/
**Authority Keywords**: "authority", "permission", "user authority", "supremacy" → core/authority.md
**Technical Keywords**: "pattern", "implementation", "code", "technical" → patterns.md
**Standards Keywords**: "standard", "compliance", "quality", "enforcement" → standards.md

### Emergency Placement Procedures
**Decision Conflict**: Use authority hierarchy (User > Vision > TRUTH_SOURCE > Specialized)
**Authority Unclear**: Default to user authority preservation and TRUTH_SOURCE validation
**Time Pressure**: Use instant placement matrix + validate later
**Complex Cases**: Escalate to interactive placement guide for detailed process

## PLACEMENT QUALITY FRAMEWORK

### Universal Placement Requirements
- **Authority Chain**: Complete traceability to supreme authority ✓
- **File Size**: ≤80 lines compliance through modular architecture ✓
- **Cross-References**: Bidirectional linking accuracy and consistency ✓
- **User Voice**: 95%+ fidelity preservation through systematic quote management ✓

### Anti-Pattern Prevention System
**Common Placement Errors**: Authority confusion, decision paralysis, reference integrity violations
**Decision Paralysis Prevention**: Visual decision tree eliminates uncertainty through systematic pathways
**Authority Confusion Resolution**: Systematic authority validation protocols with clear hierarchy
**Reference Integrity Protection**: Bidirectional reference validation requirements and consistency maintenance

### Placement Validation Protocol
**Pre-Placement**: Content analysis + authority validation + scope determination
**During Placement**: Quality gate compliance + reference integrity + authority preservation
**Post-Placement**: Integration validation + cross-reference verification + quality assurance
