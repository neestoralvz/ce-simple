# Authority Risk Assessment Patterns - Authority-Critical Component Identification

**31/07/2025 CDMX** | Systematic framework for identifying authority-critical components requiring sequential execution

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
↑ @context/architecture/patterns.md → authority-risk-assessment-patterns.md implements authority-critical identification per H6B3-CORE sequential classification evidence

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Authority chain criticality determines execution sequencing - systematic assessment prevents authority contamination"** - Framework for identifying components that affect system-wide authority chain requiring careful sequential processing.

## EMPIRICAL VALIDATION EVIDENCE

### H6B Authority Risk Assessment Success
**Authority-Critical Identification**: H6B3-CORE marked SEQUENTIAL due to authority chain dependencies
**Risk Assessment Rationale**:
- **Supreme Authority Chain**: Core architecture affects ALL system components
- **System-Wide Impact**: Authority references propagate throughout entire system
- **User Voice Fidelity**: 95%+ preservation MANDATORY for core authority components
- **Cross-System Dependencies**: Authority chain updates affect entire architecture

**Parallel Classification Success**:
- **H6B1-PATTERNS**: Technical domain with isolated authority impact → PARALLEL
- **H6B2-ROADMAP**: Coordination domain with limited authority scope → PARALLEL
- **H6B4-UX**: Interface domain with contained authority impact → PARALLEL
- **H6B5-DATA**: Validation domain with minimal authority dependencies → PARALLEL

## AUTHORITY RISK ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK

### Core Risk Classification Matrix
```
AUTHORITY RISK LEVELS:
├── CRITICAL → Sequential execution mandatory (affects supreme authority chain)
├── HIGH → Sequential preferred (significant authority implications)
├── MEDIUM → Coordination required (limited authority scope)
└── LOW → Parallel capable (isolated authority impact)
```

### Authority Impact Assessment Protocol
1. **Supreme Authority Chain Analysis**: Does component affect user→system authority flow?
2. **Cross-System Impact**: How many system components reference this authority?
3. **User Voice Concentration**: What percentage of user quotes are concentrated here?
4. **Authority Validation Dependencies**: Do other components depend on this for validation?
5. **System-Wide References**: How many incoming/outgoing authority references exist?

### Risk Assessment Decision Matrix
| Criteria | Score | Weight | Risk Level |
|----------|-------|--------|------------|
| **Supreme Authority Chain** | 0-3 | ×4 | Core authority components |
| **Cross-System Impact** | 0-3 | ×3 | System-wide reference count |
| **User Voice Concentration** | 0-3 | ×3 | Percentage of critical user quotes |
| **Authority Dependencies** | 0-3 | ×2 | Validation dependency count |
| **Reference Network** | 0-3 | ×1 | Incoming/outgoing reference density |

**Risk Score Calculation**: Total weighted score determines execution classification
- **40+**: CRITICAL → Sequential mandatory
- **30-39**: HIGH → Sequential preferred  
- **20-29**: MEDIUM → Coordination required
- **<20**: LOW → Parallel capable

## AUTHORITY-CRITICAL IDENTIFICATION PROTOCOL

### Sequential Execution Triggers
**Supreme Authority Components**: Files implementing user→system authority chain
**System-Wide Authority Validators**: Components validating authority across system
**Core Authority Hubs**: Central authority reference points for entire system
**User Voice Concentrators**: High-density user quote preservation requirements

### Authority Contamination Prevention
**Isolation Requirements**: Authority-critical components processed independently
**Validation Protocols**: 95%+ user voice fidelity monitoring during processing
**Dependency Management**: Sequential processing prevents authority chain breaks
**Rollback Capability**: Complete authority restoration if contamination detected

## PRACTICAL APPLICATION FRAMEWORK

### Pre-Processing Authority Assessment
1. **Authority Chain Mapping**: Document complete authority flow from user to implementation
2. **Reference Network Analysis**: Map all incoming/outgoing authority references
3. **User Quote Concentration**: Identify high-density user authority statement locations
4. **Cross-System Impact**: Analyze components dependent on authority validation
5. **Risk Score Calculation**: Apply decision matrix for execution classification

### Authority-Critical Processing Protocol
**Enhanced Validation**: Additional quality gates for authority preservation
**Sequential Coordination**: Process authority-critical components before dependents
**Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous authority chain integrity validation
**Expert Review**: Authority preservation validation by domain specialists

### Authority Risk Mitigation Strategies
**Pre-Processing Backup**: Complete authority state documentation before changes
**Incremental Validation**: Step-by-step authority preservation verification
**Rollback Protocols**: Complete authority restoration capability if issues detected
**Multi-Point Validation**: Authority integrity checks at multiple processing stages

## INTEGRATION WITH EXECUTION SEQUENCING

### Sequential vs Parallel Decision Logic
**Authority-Critical → Sequential**: Supreme authority chain components processed first
**Technical-Independent → Parallel**: Isolated technical domains processed concurrently
**Mixed Dependencies → Coordination**: Authority validation with parallel technical work
**Resource Optimization**: Maximum parallel execution within authority constraints

### Cross-Pattern Integration Protocol
**Work Item Density**: Density assessment identifies splitting candidates
**Parallel Creation**: Domain analysis enables parallel handoff creation
**Authority Assessment**: Risk assessment determines execution sequencing
**Quality Assurance**: All patterns serve authority preservation supremacy
