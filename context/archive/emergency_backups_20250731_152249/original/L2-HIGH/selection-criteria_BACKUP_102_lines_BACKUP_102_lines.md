## TEMPLATE DECISION MATRIX

### Primary Classification Questions

**Question 1: What is the component's primary function?**
- **Knowledge/Authority Hub** → `core_component_template.md`
- **Directory Organization** → `specialized_directory_template.md`  
- **Historical Preservation** → `archive_component_template.md`
- **Multi-Component Coordination** → `integration_hub_template.md`

**Question 2: How many other components does it connect to?**
- **0-2 connections** → `core_component_template.md` or `specialized_directory_template.md`
- **3-5 connections** → `specialized_directory_template.md` or `integration_hub_template.md`
- **6+ connections** → `integration_hub_template.md`

**Question 3: What type of content does it primarily contain?**
- **Living, evolving knowledge** → `core_component_template.md`
- **Organized file collections** → `specialized_directory_template.md`
- **Historical/archived content** → `archive_component_template.md`
- **Cross-references and coordination** → `integration_hub_template.md`

## TEMPLATE USAGE EXAMPLES

### Core Component Template
**Best for**: methodology.md, authority.md, simplicity.md, patterns.md
**Characteristics**:
- Contains authoritative knowledge that evolves
- Has L1-L2-L3 hierarchical structure
- Includes enforcement and operational patterns
- Serves as single source of truth for domain

**Example indicators**:
- File contains user quotes and supreme authority declarations
- Has methodological frameworks and protocols
- Includes enforcement patterns and anti-patterns
- Evolution happens through user vision changes

### Specialized Directory Template  
**Best for**: data/, claude_code/, resources/, research/
**Characteristics**:
- Manages organized collections of related files
- Has clear subdirectory categorization
- Provides navigation and placement guidance
- Serves specific system functions

**Example indicators**:
- Contains multiple subdirectories with different purposes
- Has semantic placement decision trees
- Provides content categorization frameworks
- Manages file organization and access patterns

### Archive Component Template
**Best for**: context/archive/, conversations_processed/, legacy/
**Characteristics**:
- Preserves historical content with ongoing value
- Maintains authority and context from original sources
- Provides access to historical decisions and evolution
- Cannot be eliminated due to preservation requirements

**Example indicators**:
- Contains content from previous system states
- Preserves historical context and decision rationale
- Maintains authority chain from original sources
- Provides reference value for current system operation

### Integration Hub Template
**Best for**: @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md, CLAUDE.md, components with 6+ cross-references
**Characteristics**:
- Coordinates multiple component interactions
- Manages complex information flows
- Orchestrates system-wide behaviors
- Serves as central coordination point

**Example indicators**:
- Referenced by many other components
- Contains coordination protocols and orchestration patterns
- Manages authority flow between multiple components
- Serves as dispatcher or central intelligence hub
