# ADR-030: H-Execute Phase 0 Validation Protocol Enhancement

**Date**: 2025-07-31  
**Status**: ACCEPTED  
**Authority**: Session insight discovery → @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → ADR-030

## Context

H-execute protocol currently assumes ROADMAP_REGISTRY.md accuracy without validation against actual completion status. Session revealed critical gap where H-SCRIPTS-CLASS showed 5% progress in registry but was actually 100% complete per final reports, causing cascade blocking of dependent handoffs.

**Problem Statement**:
- Registry synchronization relies on script execution tracking, not completion validation
- Manual intervention required when external completion occurs without registry update
- Dependent handoffs remain blocked despite completion requirements being met
- No systematic validation between registry status and actual handoff completion reports

## Decision

**IMPLEMENT PHASE 0 VALIDATION PROTOCOL** for h-execute command with automated registry-completion cross-validation.

### Phase 0 Protocol Framework:
1. **Pre-Execution Registry Validation**: Cross-validate work-items-registry.md against completion reports
2. **Automatic Status Correction**: Update completion status from IN_PROGRESS/BLOCKED to COMPLETED when validated
3. **Dependency Chain Resolution**: Automatically unblock dependent handoffs when dependencies resolved
4. **Executive Summary Sync**: Update completion statistics and ready/blocked counts

### Validation Algorithm:
- **Completion Report Scanning**: Check for [HANDOFF-ID]-FINAL-REPORT.md files with 100% completion
- **Status Mismatch Detection**: Identify discrepancies between registry and actual completion
- **Dependency Impact Analysis**: Trace dependency chains to identify unblocking opportunities
- **Automated Correction**: Apply corrections with audit trail documentation

### Integration Requirements:
- **h-execute Protocol Enhancement**: Add Phase 0 before existing execution phases
- **roadmap-update.sh Integration**: Extend script to include completion report validation
- **Audit Documentation**: Log all corrections with source validation and impact analysis

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced h-execute Flow:
```
Phase 0: Registry Validation
├── Scan for completion reports matching registry handoffs
├── Detect status mismatches (registry vs actual completion)
├── Update completion status with validation source
├── Resolve dependency chains automatically
└── Update executive summary statistics

Phase 1: Analysis & Selection (existing)
Phase 2: L4-Pure Orchestration Execution (existing) 
Phase 3: Integration & Validation (existing)
Phase 4: Context Documentation & Roadmap Sync (existing)
```

### Validation Script Integration:
- **registry-completion-validator.sh**: New script for cross-validation
- **Integration Point**: Called automatically by h-execute before execution
- **Fallback Mode**: Manual validation option when automated detection fails

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **Eliminates Manual Intervention**: Automated detection and correction of registry gaps
- **Prevents Cascade Blocking**: Dependent handoffs unblocked automatically when requirements met
- **Improves Execution Efficiency**: Accurate registry enables better handoff selection
- **Maintains Audit Trail**: Complete documentation of corrections and validation sources

### Negative:
- **Additional Complexity**: Phase 0 validation adds processing overhead
- **Dependency on File Patterns**: Relies on consistent completion report naming conventions

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to existing behavior if validation fails
- **Manual Override**: Option to skip Phase 0 for emergency execution scenarios
- **Validation Logging**: Complete audit trail for troubleshooting validation issues

## Compliance Monitoring

**Validation Protocol**: Phase 0 OBLIGATORIO for all h-execute invocations unless --skip-validation flag used
**Audit Requirements**: All status corrections DEBE be logged with validation source and impact analysis
**Error Handling**: Validation failures DEBE not prevent execution, only log warnings
**Performance Standards**: Phase 0 validation DEBE complete within 30 seconds for standard registry size

## Session Evidence

**Discovery Session**: conv-20250731_150000-h-execute-roadmap-sync-protocol-gap.md
**Concrete Impact**: H-SCRIPTS-CLASS correction unblocked H-FALLBACK-CMD and H-HOOK-INTEGR
**Quantifiable Benefit**: 2 handoffs immediately available for execution, cascade prevention
**Pattern Validation**: Additional completion detected (H6B3-CORE) during session documentation
