## WORK ITEMS ANALYSIS

### Status Distribution
- **Completed**: 21 handoffs + 2 phases = **23/35 items (66%)**
- **Active**: 1 item in progress (P0B-CLEANUP 50%)
- **Ready**: 5 items ready for execution  
- **Blocked**: 6 items waiting for dependencies

### SCP Profile Distribution
- **S1 (Focused)**: 3 items - Quick wins, minimal coordination
- **S2 (Cross)**: 26 items - Standard complexity, cross-domain  
- **S3 (System)**: 6 items - High impact, architectural changes

- **C1 (Independent)**: 8 items - Parallel execution possible
- **C2 (Dependent)**: 22 items - Sequential coordination required
- **C3 (Orchestrated)**: 5 items - Complex coordination needed

- **P1 (Direct)**: 7 items - Standard implementation patterns
- **P2 (Extraction)**: 25 items - L2-MODULAR processing required
- **P3 (Coordination)**: 3 items - Complex orchestration needed

### Most Common Profiles
- **S2C2P2** (13 items): Standard complex handoffs, 2-day timeline
- **S3C3P3** (3 items): Maximum complexity, 4-5 day timeline
- **S1C1P1** (1 item): Minimal complexity, 4-hour timeline

### Resource Planning by SCP
- **Low Complexity** (S1C1P1, S1C2P1): 4-6 hours each
- **Medium Complexity** (S2C1P2, S2C2P1): 1-2 days each  
- **High Complexity** (S2C2P2, S3C2P2): 2-3 days each
- **Critical Complexity** (S3C3P3): 4-5 days each

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- **C1 Independent**: H6D-SCRIPTS, H-AUTOCONTAIN, P0B-CLEANUP can run parallel
- **Similar Profiles**: S2C2P2 handoffs can be batched with shared patterns
- **Resource Optimization**: Group by P-level for specialized processing

### Critical Path Analysis
- **P0B-CLEANUP** (S2C1P2, 4d) ‚Üí Unlocks P1-P7 cascade (6 blocked items)
- **H-AUTOCONTAIN** (S2C1P1, 1d) ‚Üí Unblocks H-SYSTEM-TEST (S3C3P3, 4d)
- **Sequential Chain**: H6B3-CORE ‚Üí H6B-L2-MOD-AUTO (S3C2P2 + S2C2P3 = 6d total)

### Time Estimation Summary
- **Remaining Work**: ~35 days total estimated effort
- **Parallel Optimization**: ~20-25 days with strategic batching
- **Critical Path**: ~15 days for essential unlocking sequence
