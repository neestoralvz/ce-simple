## PERFORMANCE MONITORING FRAMEWORK

### **Decision Time Metrics**
```
Decision Speed Measurement:
├── Baseline Metrics (Pre-Flowchart)
│   ├── Simple content placement: Average 45-120 seconds
│   ├── Complex content placement: Average 180-600 seconds
│   ├── Authority validation: Average 30-90 seconds
│   └── Emergency decisions: Average 300-900 seconds
├── Target Metrics (With Flowchart)
│   ├── Simple content placement: <10 seconds target
│   ├── Complex content placement: <30 seconds target
│   ├── Authority validation: <15 seconds target
│   └── Emergency decisions: <5 seconds activation target
└── Performance Tracking
    ├── Real-time decision time monitoring
    ├── Trend analysis and performance optimization
    ├── Bottleneck identification and resolution
    └── Continuous improvement measurement
```

### **Accuracy Metrics**
```
Placement Accuracy Assessment:
├── Accuracy Categories
│   ├── Correct placement: Content placed optimally per authority/standards
│   ├── Acceptable placement: Content placed correctly but suboptimally
│   ├── Incorrect placement: Content misplaced requiring correction
│   └── Authority violation: Placement violating user authority requirements
├── Target Accuracy Rates
│   ├── Standard content: >98% correct placement rate
│   ├── Complex content: >95% correct placement rate
│   ├── Edge cases: >90% acceptable placement rate
│   └── Authority preservation: 100% compliance rate
└── Accuracy Monitoring
    ├── Real-time placement outcome tracking
    ├── User feedback integration for accuracy assessment
    ├── Long-term accuracy trend analysis
    └── Improvement opportunity identification
```

### **System Efficiency Metrics**
```
System Resource Impact:
├── Computational Overhead
│   ├── Flowchart processing time measurement
│   ├── Memory usage during decision processes
│   ├── Context loading efficiency assessment
│   └── Integration pathway performance monitoring
├── User Experience Impact
│   ├── Cognitive load reduction measurement
│   ├── Decision confidence improvement tracking
│   ├── Error reduction quantification
│   └── Learning curve optimization assessment
└── System Integration Efficiency
    ├── Cross-component navigation performance
    ├── Reference system responsiveness
    ├── Authority validation speed
    └── Overall workflow integration effectiveness
```

### **Quality Metrics**
```
Quality Assurance Measurement:
├── Authority Preservation Quality
│   ├── Authority chain integrity maintenance: 100% target
│   ├── User voice fidelity preservation: >95% target
│   ├── Authority conflict resolution effectiveness: >98% target
│   └── Supreme authority compliance: 100% target
├── Standards Compliance Quality
│   ├── Standards adherence rate: >99% target
│   ├── Quality gate effectiveness: >95% target
│   ├── Compliance validation accuracy: >98% target
│   └── Standards evolution adaptation: <24 hours target
└── User Satisfaction Quality
    ├── User approval of placement decisions: >90% target
    ├── Flowchart usability rating: >85% target
    ├── Decision confidence improvement: >80% target
    └── Overall system satisfaction: >88% target
```
