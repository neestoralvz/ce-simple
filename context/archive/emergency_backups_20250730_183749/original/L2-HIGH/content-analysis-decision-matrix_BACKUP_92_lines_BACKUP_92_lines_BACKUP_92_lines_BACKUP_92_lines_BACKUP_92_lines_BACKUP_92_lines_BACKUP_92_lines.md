## DECISION SYNTHESIS FRAMEWORK

### **Analysis Output Framework**
```
Content Analysis Results Protocol:
├── Primary Domain Assignment
│   ├── Domain: [Identified primary domain]
│   ├── Confidence: [High/Medium/Low confidence in assignment]
│   ├── Rationale: [Reasoning for domain assignment]
│   └── Secondary domains: [Additional domains if applicable]
├── Authority Classification
│   ├── Authority source: [User/System/Shared authority]
│   ├── Authority level: [Supreme/Primary/Secondary authority]
│   ├── Authority requirements: [Validation and preservation needs]
│   └── Authority conflicts: [Identified conflicts and resolution needs]
├── Scope Determination
│   ├── Impact scope: [Component/Cross-component/System-wide]
│   ├── Integration complexity: [Simple/Moderate/Complex integration]
│   ├── Dependencies: [Identified dependencies and relationships]
│   └── Integration pathways: [Required integration connections]
└── Implementation Requirements
    ├── Size constraints: [File size and modularization needs]
    ├── Quality gates: [Required validation and compliance checks]
    ├── Reference requirements: [Cross-reference and navigation needs]
    └── Evolution compatibility: [Organic growth and adaptation needs]
```

### **Decision Confidence Assessment**
```
Decision Confidence Framework:
├── High Confidence Indicators
│   ├── Clear domain classification with single primary domain
│   ├── Unambiguous authority source identification
│   ├── Well-defined scope with clear integration pathways
│   └── Standard implementation requirements
├── Medium Confidence Indicators
│   ├── Primary domain clear but secondary domains involved
│   ├── Authority source identified but some complexity
│   ├── Scope defined but integration considerations required
│   └── Implementation requirements need specific attention
├── Low Confidence Indicators
│   ├── Domain classification ambiguous or multiple primaries
│   ├── Authority source unclear or conflicted
│   ├── Scope unclear or significant system implications
│   └── Implementation requirements complex or undefined
└── Confidence Improvement Protocol
    ├── Additional analysis required for low confidence
    ├── Expert consultation for authority clarification
    ├── Scope research for unclear impact assessment
    └── Implementation planning for complex requirements
```

### **Decision Validation Protocol**
```
Decision Validation Framework:
├── Analysis Completeness Validation
│   ├── All analysis questions addressed systematically  
│   ├── Domain identification matrix properly applied
│   ├── Authority validation completed appropriately
│   └── Scope assessment comprehensive and accurate
├── Decision Logic Validation
│   ├── Decision rationale clear and well-documented
│   ├── Alternative options considered and evaluated
│   ├── Risk assessment completed for decision
│   └── Success criteria defined for implementation
├── Authority Preservation Validation
│   ├── User authority supremacy maintained through decision
│   ├── Authority chain integrity preserved
│   ├── Authority conflicts identified and resolution planned
│   └── Authority validation mechanisms established
└── Quality Assurance Validation
    ├── Standards compliance verified for decision
    ├── Quality gates identified and planned
    ├── Integration requirements validated
    └── Evolution compatibility confirmed
```
