## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
session-analysis/ → discovery-through-elimination-methodology.md implements methodology validation per session authority

## DISCOVERY THROUGH ELIMINATION METHODOLOGY VALIDATED

### **Empirical Approach Framework**
- **Structure discovered**: Through systematic elimination testing
- **Evidence-based decisions**: Elimination → testing → functional core preservation
- **Authority preservation**: User domain protected during implementation optimization

### **Methodology Application Process**
**Discovery Method**: Systematic elimination with functionality testing
**Validation Protocol**: Evidence-based structure determination vs theoretical analysis
**Authority Integration**: User domain protection throughout optimization process

### **Empirical Validation Results**
**Method Validation**: Discovery through elimination proves effective
**Evidence Priority**: Evidence-based structure determination > theoretical preservation
**Functional Testing**: Elimination → testing → functional core identification
**Authority Maintenance**: User domain preserved during system optimization

## METHODOLOGY LEARNING INTEGRATION

### **Validated Patterns**
