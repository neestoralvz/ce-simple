## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
placement-methodology/README.md → authority-chain-verification.md implements authority chain validation per methodology authority

## AUTHORITY CHAIN VERIFICATION FRAMEWORK

### **Authority Chain Traceability Protocol**
```
Authority Chain Verification:
├── Supreme Authority Traceability
│   ├── VISION.md → User supreme authority verification
│   ├── @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → Context architecture authority
│   ├── Specialized context → Domain authority validation
│   └── Implementation → Authority compliance verification
├── Authority Flow Validation
│   ├── Authority source → Authority delegation → Authority implementation
│   ├── Authority preservation through chain levels
│   ├── Authority modification tracking and validation
│   └── Authority integrity maintenance throughout chain
├── Authority Link Verification
│   ├── Each authority link validated for integrity
│   ├── Authority gaps identified and addressed
│   ├── Authority conflicts detected and resolved
│   └── Authority chain completeness confirmed
└── Authority Chain Documentation
    ├── Complete authority chain mapping
    ├── Authority relationship documentation
    ├── Authority change history tracking
    └── Authority validation evidence recording
```

### **Authority Preservation Requirements**
```
Authority Preservation Framework:
├── User Voice Fidelity Requirements
│   ├── User voice fidelity ≥95% requirement
│   ├── Exact user quote preservation when possible
│   ├── User intent preservation when paraphrasing required
│   └── User authority supremacy maintenance throughout chain
├── Authority Chain Integrity Maintenance
│   ├── Authority chain completeness: No missing links
│   ├── Authority chain consistency: No contradictions
│   ├── Authority chain traceability: Clear path to source
│   └── Authority chain validation: Regular integrity checks
├── Authority Contamination Prevention
│   ├── Clean authority sources without interpretation drift
│   ├── Authority modification tracking for accountability
│   ├── Bias prevention through systematic validation
│   └── Clean slate capability for authority restoration
└── Clean Slate Capability
    ├── Authority restoration when contamination detected
    ├── Clean slate regeneration protocols
    ├── Authority purity maintenance mechanisms
    └── Authority validation reset procedures
```

### **Authority Validation Checkpoints**
```
Authority Validation Checkpoint Protocol:
├── Pre-Placement Authority Verification
│   ├── Authority source identification and validation
│   ├── Authority chain integrity confirmation
│   ├── Authority conflicts detection and resolution
│   └── Authority preservation requirements assessment
├── During-Placement Authority Preservation
│   ├── Authority chain maintenance during placement process
│   ├── Authority integrity monitoring throughout implementation
│   ├── Authority contamination prevention during modification
│   └── Authority validation checkpoint execution at each step
├── Post-Placement Authority Integrity Validation
│   ├── Authority chain integrity confirmation after placement
│   ├── Authority preservation effectiveness verification
│   ├── Authority contamination detection and remediation
│   └── Authority validation system integration confirmation
└── Ongoing Authority Chain Monitoring
    ├── Regular authority chain integrity assessments
    ├── Authority contamination detection and prevention
    ├── Authority evolution tracking and validation
    └── Authority restoration procedures when needed
```
