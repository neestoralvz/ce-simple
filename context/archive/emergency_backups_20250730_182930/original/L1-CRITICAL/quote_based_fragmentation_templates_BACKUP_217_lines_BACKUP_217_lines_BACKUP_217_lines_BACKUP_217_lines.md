2. Thematic clustering → Group related concepts maintaining context  
3. Synthesis distillation → Create operational insights from quotes
4. Reference architecture → Link fragments through authority preservation
5. Validation → Verify 95%+ user voice fidelity maintenance

AUTHORITY PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Exact quote preservation with contextual information
- User decision documentation with implementation traceability
- Authority statement categorization (decision/vision/quality/contextual)
- Cross-reference system linking fragments to original authority

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Modular files (≤80 lines each) with preserved user quotes
- Synthesis document with operational insights
- Cross-reference mapping maintaining authority chain
- Validation report confirming user voice fidelity (95%+ standard)",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
