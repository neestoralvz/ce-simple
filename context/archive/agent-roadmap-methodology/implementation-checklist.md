**31/07/2025 CDMX** | Systematic implementation protocol with success validation

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
agent-instruction-roadmap-methodology-final-hub.md → implementation-checklist.md implements deployment framework per hub authority

## IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST COMPLETO

### ✅ **Setup Phase [METODOLOGÍA COMPLETA]**
- [ ] Create `ROADMAP_REGISTRY.md` with 8-innovation structure
- [ ] Implement density analysis with task estimation
- [ ] Setup issues evolution pipeline with 3-tier classification
- [ ] Configure transformation matrix with promotion criteria
- [ ] Create file naming congruency system
- [ ] Setup risk-stratified migration protocols

### ✅ **Integration Phase [AVANZADA]**  
- [ ] Deploy density assessment automation tools
- [ ] Implement issue transformation assessment engine
- [ ] Setup split recommendation monitoring
- [ ] Configure handoff creation protocols
- [ ] Test transformation workflow end-to-end
- [ ] Validate authority preservation throughout

### ✅ **Operation Phase [MAESTRÍA]**
- [ ] Launch complete methodology with all 8 innovations
- [ ] Execute first density-driven split (following P0 success pattern)
- [ ] Process first issue→handoff transformation 
- [ ] Monitor complexity evolution across all work streams
- [ ] Establish rhythm for transformation assessments
- [ ] Track success metrics across all innovation areas

## SUCCESS CRITERIA MAESTRÍA

### **Quantitative Targets [METODOLOGÍA COMPLETA]**
- **Density Management**: 100% work items within optimal density ranges
- **Issue Evolution**: Systematic 3-tier classification with growth tracking
- **Transformation Efficiency**: >80% promotion accuracy using criteria matrix
- **Split Success**: Proven with P0A→P0B pattern (completed + in progress)
