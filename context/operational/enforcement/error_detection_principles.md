# Error Detection Principles - Framework Core Goals

**29/07/2025** | Proactive error identification principles + DO/DON'T patterns

## Framework Purpose

### Error Detection Goals
- **Proactive identification** of systematic errors before user reports them
- **Pattern recognition** for recurring error types across system components
- **Automated validation** integration into workflow execution  
- **Learning integration** para continuous error prevention improvement

## DO/DON'T Detection Framework

### DO - Proactive Error Detection
- **Implement validation checkpoints** throughout workflow execution
- **Monitor state consistency** between internal progress y external reporting
- **Apply pattern recognition** para systematic error identification
- **Integrate user feedback** as error detection signal enhancement

### DON'T - Reactive Error Management
- **Wait for user error reports** before implementing detection
- **Ignore error patterns** that appear across multiple instances
- **Skip validation steps** during complex workflow execution
- **Dismiss user corrections** as isolated incidents

## Detection Philosophy

### Proactive vs Reactive Approach
**Proactive advantages**:
- Prevents user frustration through early error identification
- Maintains system reliability through systematic validation
- Enables continuous improvement through pattern learning
- Preserves user trust through consistent accuracy

**Reactive disadvantages**:
- Creates user friction through error exposure
- Compromises system reliability through delayed detection
- Misses systematic improvement opportunities
- Erodes user confidence in system behavior

### Pattern Recognition Priority
**High priority patterns**: State synchronization errors, progress tracking inconsistencies
**Medium priority patterns**: Documentation accuracy issues, workflow chain problems
**Low priority patterns**: Cosmetic issues, optimization opportunities

### Validation Integration Strategy
**Mandatory checkpoints**: Pre-execution, during-execution, post-execution, pre-communication
**Optional enhancements**: Pattern monitoring, learning integration, feedback processing
**System integration**: Command templates, methodology modules, workflow protocols
