# Next Action Methodology Integration - Analysis & Execution Patterns

**29/07/2025** | Methodology command next action patterns + integration logic

## Analysis Methodologies Next Action

**Pattern**: Return to original command with analysis insights
```markdown
## Next Action
- **Context**: Continue with command that invoked methodology
- **If conflicts**: Escalate to /roles:partner for resolution
- **If additional analysis needed**: Chain to related methodology
```

### Think x4 Integration
- **Normal completion**: Return to invoking command with 4-perspective analysis
- **Conflicts detected**: Escalate to /roles:partner for authority resolution
- **Additional analysis required**: Chain to domain-specific methodology

### Research Methodologies Integration
- **Research complete**: Return findings to orchestrator or suggest /actions:build
- **Additional investigation**: Chain to specialized research approach
- **Authority validation needed**: Route to /methodology:validation_protocol

## Execution Methodologies Next Action

**Pattern**: Enhance execution of calling command
```markdown
## Next Action
- **Context**: Continue execution with methodology applied
- **If optimization available**: Suggest efficiency improvements
- **If conflicts detected**: Route to conflict resolution
```

### Parallel Execution Integration
- **Optimization identified**: Apply concurrent tools methodology
- **Workflow enhanced**: Continue with improved execution pattern
- **Conflicts with sequential**: Route to methodology reconciliation

### Continuous Flow Integration
- **Flow established**: Continue automated execution without interruption
- **Interruption required**: Clear exception handling and user communication
- **Workflow completion**: Route to appropriate completion command

## Validation Methodologies Next Action

**Pattern**: Route based on validation results
```markdown
## Next Action
- **If validation passed**: Continue with original workflow
- **If validation failed**: Route to /workflows:debug or /roles:partner
- **If authority conflict**: Escalate to user for resolution
```

### Authority Alignment Validation
- **Alignment confirmed**: Continue with original workflow unmodified
- **Alignment issues**: Route to /roles:partner for authority clarification
- **System conflicts**: Escalate to user decision with clear options

### Quality Standards Validation
- **Standards met**: Progress to next logical workflow step
- **Standards failed**: Route to /workflows:debug for systematic resolution
- **Improvement opportunities**: Suggest optimization while continuing

## Methodology Chain Logic

### Sequential Methodology Application
- **Analysis → Execution**: thinkx4 → parallel_execution → continuous_flow
- **Execution → Validation**: Implementation → authority_alignment → quality_validation
- **Research → Documentation**: research_first → docs → git_integration

### Methodology Conflict Resolution
- **Competing methodologies**: Route to /roles:partner for resolution
- **Methodology gaps**: Identify missing methodology and suggest addition
- **Methodology redundancy**: Optimize methodology chain for efficiency
