# Multi-Conversation Git-Native Implementation

Git worktrees architecture for parallel conversation support.

## Git Worktrees Architecture Protocol
**Branch-Per-Conversation Pattern:**
→ Ver context/examples/bash/git_worktree_management.sh:create_conversation_branch() para patrón completo

**Implementation Requirements:**
- **Independent execution** → Commands run in separate git branches
- **Parallel capability** → Support N conversations (4+ as needed)
- **User ultra-orchestration** → User coordinates multiple agent conversations
- **State isolation** → Prevent cross-conversation conflicts

## Inter-Conversation Communication Implementation
**Ticket System Protocol:**
- **Shared state artifacts** → Communication via files accessible to all branches
- **Asynchronous coordination** → Messages/tickets between conversations
- **Status synchronization** → Central monitoring system tracks all conversations
- **Merge coordination** → User orchestrates integration of parallel results

## Git-Native Multi-Branch Pattern
**Architecture Foundation:**
- **Git worktrees as infrastructure** → Core system designed around git branches
- **Branch strategy** → Each complex task gets dedicated branch
- **Merge orchestration** → User coordinates branch integration
- **Conflict resolution** → Authority hierarchy resolves integration conflicts

## Multi-Conversation Quality Management
**Quality Across Branches:**
- **Independent validation** → Each conversation validates its output
- **Integration quality** → User orchestrates quality across conversations
- **Consistency maintenance** → Authority hierarchy ensures coherence
- **Error propagation prevention** → Isolate failures to individual branches

**Git-native principle**: Git infrastructure enables sophisticated multi-conversation orchestration with user coordination.
