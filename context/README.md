# Context System - Navigation Hub

**30/07/2025 21:30 CDMX** | Central dispatcher for complete context architecture

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
context/vision/vision_foundation.md → supreme user authority → TRUTH_SOURCE.md → context/ system serves vision discovery

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Context como padre de todo"** - Complete knowledge system organized for conversation-first development with vision-driven evolution

## NAVIGATION INTELLIGENCE
**Quick Start Guidance**: → architecture/navigation/README.md
**Authority Hierarchy**: → architecture/navigation/README.md (authority chain implementation)
**System Behavior**: → architecture/navigation/README.md (context loading protocols)
**Navigation Pathways**: → architecture/navigation/README.md (workflow guidance)

## CORE CONTEXT COMPONENTS

### Root Authority Files
- **`TRUTH_SOURCE.md`** - Central dispatcher with semantic triggers and decision logic
- **`authority.md`** - Complete authority framework with user domain boundaries
- **`methodology.md`** - Comprehensive methodology consolidation with Think x4 protocol
- **`simplicity.md`** - User beauty philosophy with complexity balance
- **`architecture/patterns.md`** - Working patterns and architectural guidance  
- **`standards.md`** - System standards reference hub with enforcement
- **`templates.md`** - Complete template authority and usage protocols

### Specialized Directories
**`/architecture/`**: Structural intelligence (ADRs, standards, UX patterns, workflows, navigation)
**`/data/`**: Information management (conversations, performance, validation metrics)  
**`/vision/`**: Vision evolution (discovery and crystallization documentation)
**`/resources/`**: Support materials serving core system needs
**`/archive/`**: Historical preservation (processed conversations, legacy systems)

## SYSTEM INTEGRATION
**CLAUDE.md**: Context system serves as intelligence backend for semantic triggers and decision logic
**Commands**: All `.claude/commands/` reference context system for authority, methodology, and template guidance  
**Conversation-First**: Architecture serves natural conversation discovery rather than imposing predetermined structure

## ORGANIZATION PRINCIPLES
**Reference-Only**: Zero duplication + 80-line maximum + authority chain preservation + token economy optimization
**User Authority**: 95%+ fidelity + vision supremacy + information density + organic evolution
**Quality Standards**: Think x4 protocol + research-first + continuous execution + authority validation

## EVOLUTION PROTOCOL
**Adaptation Triggers**: Vision discovery → system evolution | Architecture needs → context expansion | Usage patterns → organic growth | Quality improvements → standards evolution
**Growth Management**: Semantic placement + modular expansion + legacy preservation + vision alignment validation
