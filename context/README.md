# Context System - Navigation Hub

**30/07/2025 15:55 CDMX** | Central dispatcher for complete context architecture

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
context/principles/vision_foundation.md → supreme user authority → TRUTH_SOURCE.md → context/ system serves vision discovery

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Context como padre de todo"** - Complete knowledge system organized for conversation-first development with vision-driven evolution

## QUICK START NAVIGATION

### "I need to understand the system" 
**Start here**: `TRUTH_SOURCE.md` → Core architecture dispatcher
**Then explore**: `principles/vision_foundation.md` → Foundation philosophy

### "I want to implement something"
**Start here**: `methodology.md` → Complete implementation authority
**Then reference**: `templates.md` → Implementation templates
**Quality check**: `standards.md` → Enforcement requirements

### "I need to make architectural decisions"
**Start here**: `authority.md` → Decision-making framework
**Structural guidance**: `architecture/` → Specialized architecture hub
**Vision alignment**: `principles/` → Core principles authority

### "I want to understand patterns and examples"
**Working patterns**: `patterns/` → Validated patterns library
**Template library**: `templates.md` → Complete template authority
**Claude Code specific**: `claude_code/` → CLI integration patterns

## CORE CONTEXT COMPONENTS

### Root Authority Files
- **`TRUTH_SOURCE.md`** - Central dispatcher with semantic triggers and decision logic
- **`authority.md`** - Complete authority framework with user domain boundaries
- **`methodology.md`** - Comprehensive methodology consolidation with Think x4 protocol
- **`simplicity.md`** - User beauty philosophy with complexity balance
- **`patterns.md`** - Working patterns and architectural guidance  
- **`standards.md`** - System standards reference hub with enforcement
- **`templates.md`** - Complete template authority and usage protocols

### Specialized Directories

#### `/architecture/` - Structural Intelligence
**Purpose**: Architecture decisions, standards, and structural patterns
**Key components**: ADRs, technical standards, UX patterns, workflows
**Authority**: Structure follows discovered function, not predetermined design

#### `/claude_code/` - CLI Integration Hub  
**Purpose**: Claude Code CLI specific patterns and integrations
**Key components**: Actions, orchestration, roles, methodology
**Authority**: Modern CLI standards 2025 with conversation-first design

#### `/data/` - Information Management
**Purpose**: Conversation data, performance metrics, usage patterns
**Key components**: Conversations, validation data, performance tracking
**Authority**: Information preservation with privacy compliance

#### `/patterns/` - Pattern Library
**Purpose**: Validated patterns vs failed patterns analysis
**Key components**: Working patterns, failed patterns documentation
**Authority**: Evidence-based pattern validation through usage

#### `/principles/` - Foundation Authority
**Purpose**: Core vision principles and philosophical foundations
**Key components**: Vision foundation, authority system, evolution dynamics
**Authority**: Supreme user vision preservation and organic adaptation

#### `/research/` - Investigation Hub
**Purpose**: Research findings and system optimization analysis
**Key components**: Methodology analysis, system optimization, technical innovations
**Authority**: Research-first protocol with WebSearch + MCP integration

#### `/resources/` - Support Materials
**Purpose**: Supporting resources and reference materials
**Authority**: Supplementary information serving core system needs

#### `/vision/` - Vision Evolution
**Purpose**: Vision discovery and evolution documentation
**Authority**: Natural conversation leads to vision crystallization

### Archive System
#### `/archive/` - Historical Preservation
**Purpose**: Processed conversations, legacy systems, eliminated components
**Key components**: Conversation processing, methodologies consolidated, session archives
**Authority**: Complete information preservation during system evolution

## SYSTEM BEHAVIOR EXPECTATIONS

### Context Loading Protocol
**Core Always Loaded**: vision_foundation.md, TRUTH_SOURCE.md, authority.md, methodology.md, simplicity.md
**Conditional Loading**: Based on semantic triggers and task patterns
**Reference-Only**: No content duplication - smart references preserve token economy

### Navigation Pathways

#### Vision Discovery Flow
```
User conversation → vision_foundation.md → TRUTH_SOURCE.md → appropriate context → implementation
```

#### Implementation Flow  
```
Requirements → methodology.md → patterns.md → templates.md → standards.md → execution
```

#### Architecture Flow
```
Structural need → authority.md → architecture/ → decision validation → implementation
```

#### Research Flow
```
Investigation need → research/ → methodology research-first protocol → findings integration
```

## INTEGRATION WITH SYSTEM COMPONENTS

### CLAUDE.md Integration
Context system serves as intelligence backend for CLAUDE.md semantic triggers and decision logic

### Command System Integration  
All `.claude/commands/` reference context system for authority, methodology, and template guidance

### Conversation-First Design
System architecture serves natural conversation discovery rather than imposing predetermined structure

## CONTENT ORGANIZATION PRINCIPLES

### Reference-Only Architecture
- **Zero duplication** - single source of truth with smart references
- **80-line maximum** per file with modular factorization  
- **Authority chain preservation** through hierarchical references
- **Token economy optimization** through conditional loading

### User Authority Preservation
- **95%+ fidelity requirement** for user voice preservation
- **Vision supremacy** over technical optimization
- **Information density** over structural simplification
- **Organic evolution** based on conversation discovery

### Quality Standards
- **Think x4 protocol** for systematic analysis
- **Research-first** with concurrent WebSearch + MCP
- **Continuous execution** without friction interruption
- **Authority validation** against TRUTH_SOURCE.md

## EVOLUTION PROTOCOL

### System Adaptation Triggers
- Vision discovery conversations → system evolution
- Architecture needs → context expansion  
- Usage patterns → organic growth authorization
- Quality improvements → standards evolution

### Growth Management
- **Semantic placement** based on content type and usage
- **Modular expansion** preserving authority hierarchy
- **Legacy preservation** through archive system
- **Vision alignment** validation for all changes
