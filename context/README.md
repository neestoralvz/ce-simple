# Context System - Pure Dispatcher

**30/07/2025 22:30 CDMX** | Single entry point for complete context architecture

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
vision/vision_foundation.md → supreme user authority → architecture/core/@context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → context/ system serves vision discovery

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Context como padre de todo"** - Complete knowledge system organized for conversation-first development with vision-driven evolution

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### **CORE SYSTEM** (architecture/core/)
- **`@context/architecture/core/truth-source.md`** - Central dispatcher with semantic triggers and decision logic  
- **`authority.md`** - Complete authority framework with user domain boundaries
- **`methodology.md`** - Comprehensive methodology consolidation with Think x4 protocol

### **INTEGRATION SYSTEM** (architecture/integration/)
- **`component-decision-matrix.md`** - Integration pathways authority hub
- **`cross-reference-system.md`** - Reference architecture authority hub  
- **`migration-rules.md`** - System evolution authority hub
- **`navigation-integration.md`** - Semantic trigger navigation hub

### **VISION SYSTEM** (vision/)
- **`vision_foundation.md`** - Core vision principles and discovery philosophy
- **`simplicity.md`** - User beauty philosophy with complexity balance
- **`README.md`** - Vision discovery and crystallization hub

### **ARCHITECTURE SYSTEM** (architecture/)
- **`standards/README.md`** - System standards reference hub with enforcement
- **`templates/README.md`** - Complete template authority and usage protocols
- **`patterns.md`** - Working patterns and architectural guidance
- **`navigation/README.md`** - Complete navigation intelligence
- **`reference/README.md`** - Reference architecture implementation
- **`adr/`** - Architecture decision records
- **`ux/`** - User experience architecture  
- **`workflows/`** - Process architecture

### **SPECIALIZED DIRECTORIES**
- **`data/`** - Information management (conversations, performance, validation metrics)
- **`resources/`** - Support materials serving core system needs  
- **`archive/`** - Historical preservation (processed conversations, legacy systems)
- **`handoffs/`** - System handoff protocols and phase management

## ENTRY PATHWAYS

### "I need to understand the system"
**START**: `vision/vision_foundation.md` → `architecture/core/@context/architecture/core/truth-source.md` → navigate based on needs

### "I want to implement something"  
**START**: `architecture/core/methodology.md` → `architecture/templates/README.md` → `architecture/standards/README.md`

### "I need to make decisions"
**START**: `architecture/core/authority.md` → `architecture/integration/component-decision-matrix.md` → domain-specific guidance

### "I want to understand architecture"
**START**: `architecture/core/@context/architecture/core/truth-source.md` → `architecture/patterns.md` → specialized architecture components

## SYSTEM INTEGRATION
**CLAUDE.md**: Context system serves as intelligence backend for semantic triggers and decision logic
**Commands**: All `.claude/commands/` reference context system for authority, methodology, and template guidance
**Conversation-First**: Architecture serves natural conversation discovery rather than imposing predetermined structure

**CONTEXT SYSTEM DECLARATION**: Pure dispatcher implementing user vision of comprehensive context engineering. All functionality organized in specialized subdirectories with single-entry navigation.

**ORGANIZATION PRINCIPLE**: Only README.md in root + complete functionality through modular architecture preserving user authority supremacy.
