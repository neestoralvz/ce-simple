## Monitoring Protocols

### Automated Health Checks
- **Daily**: File integrity verification
- **Weekly**: Cross-reference validation  
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive dependency audit

### Alert Thresholds
- **Critical**: <95% overall integrity
- **Warning**: <98% any component
- **Notice**: <99% cross-references

### Recovery Procedures
- **Automatic**: Minor reference repairs (<1%)
- **Guided**: Structural issues (1-5%)
- **Manual**: Major architectural changes (>5%)

## Recent Interventions

### 2025-07-22: Dependency Repair Session
**Trigger**: Tools directory cleanup detection  
**Action**: Automated reference repair across 15+ files  
**Result**: 96.4% â†’ 98.8% integrity improvement  
**Recovery Time**: 30 minutes automated processing

### Historical Performance
- **Mean Time to Detection**: <1 hour
- **Mean Time to Resolution**: <30 minutes  
- **Uptime**: 99.7% (excluding planned maintenance)
- **False Positive Rate**: <0.1%
