# Resources Component - External Knowledge Hub

**30/07/2025 11:30 CDMX** | External references, assets, and knowledge integration

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
↑ @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → resources/ organizes external knowledge while preserving user vision supremacy

## PURPOSE
External knowledge integration and reference management. Curate and organize external knowledge to inform system development without contaminating user vision with external biases.

## CONTENT ORGANIZATION

### Current Structure
**Flat Directory Design**: Intentionally simple structure allowing organic growth based on actual resource accumulation patterns.

### Anticipated Growth Patterns
As resources accumulate organically:
- **Technical References**: Claude Code documentation, AI development best practices, CLI standards
- **Research Materials**: Industry patterns, conversation design research, context engineering studies  
- **Asset Collections**: Templates, examples, configuration files, reusable components
- **Knowledge Integration**: External insights validated against user vision, filtered research outcomes

## INTEGRATION POINTS

### → @context/architecture/core/methodology.md
**Connection**: External best practices integrated into methodologies when vision-aligned
**Protocol**: Research-First protocol leverages resources while preserving methodology integrity

### → @context/architecture/patterns.md
**Connection**: External pattern libraries filtered through user vision compatibility
**Protocol**: Industry patterns adapted to serve conversation-first development philosophy

### → WebSearch + MCP Integration
**Connection**: External search results processed and stored when valuable for future reference
**Protocol**: Knowledge integration maintains user authority supremacy over external recommendations

## EVOLUTION GUIDELINES

### Resource Curation Principles
1. **Vision Alignment First**: External resources must serve user vision, not redirect it
2. **Bias Prevention**: External knowledge filtered to prevent contamination of user authority
3. **Practical Utility**: Resources included only when demonstrable system improvement value
4. **Organic Accumulation**: Structure grows from actual resource needs, not theoretical organization

### Resource Integration Protocol
1. **External Discovery** → Research-First protocol identifies valuable resources
2. **Vision Compatibility Assessment** → Resource evaluated against user authority framework
3. **Bias Filtration** → External knowledge processed to remove interpretation contamination
4. **Organic Integration** → Resource integrated only when system demonstrates necessity

### Quality Control Standards
- **Source Authority Validation**: External resources from authoritative, unbiased sources
- **User Authority Protection**: No external resource compromises user vision supremacy
- **Organic Necessity**: Resources added only when system evolution demonstrates need

### Knowledge Integration Framework
**Pattern**: External discovery → Vision compatibility → Filtered integration → User validation
**Anti-Pattern**: External best practices applied without user vision alignment
**Validation**: All resource integration subject to user authority override

### Placement Logic
**External to system** → resources/
**Requires vision validation** → Process through authority framework first
**Future reference** → Store with vision compatibility notes
**Methodology information** → Cross-reference with methodology.md
