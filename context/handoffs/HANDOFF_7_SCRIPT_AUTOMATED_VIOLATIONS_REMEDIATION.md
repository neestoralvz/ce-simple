# HANDOFF 7: Script-Automated Violations Remediation System

**31/07/2025 CDMX** | Systematic script-driven violations processing with human oversight

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → HANDOFF_7 implements script-automated remediation per systematic automation authority

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Systematic automation with human oversight maximizes efficiency while preserving authority"** - Leverages existing script ecosystem for accelerated violations processing with checkpoints for authority preservation and quality assurance.

## GIT WORKTREE SETUP

### Pre-Execution Commands
```bash
# Create dedicated worktree for script-automated handoff
git worktree add ../ce-simple-script-automation master
cd ../ce-simple-script-automation
git checkout -b script-automated-remediation

# Verify script ecosystem is available
ls scripts/
# Expected: analyze_violations.sh, backup_secure.sh, extract_assisted.sh, validate_integrity.sh, rollback_safe.sh
```

## HANDOFF 7 SYSTEM MODULES

### **Automation Strategy**
**Module**: → handoff-7-system/automation-strategy.md
**Content**: Detailed script integration phases, target categorization, and quality gates
**Authority**: Complete automation strategy and batch processing protocols

### **Execution Timeline**
**Module**: → handoff-7-system/execution-timeline.md  
**Content**: 3-day implementation protocol with checkpoint validation and success metrics
