- Fallback command routing and execution logic
- Error handling and recovery protocols
- User experience preservation during system issues

### **H-AUTOCONTAIN Implementation**
**Status**: READY for execution  
**Dependencies**: H-CORE-DISPATCH foundation
**Domain**: Commands Validation System
**Objectives**:
- Command validation before execution
- Containment protocols for command safety
- Authority validation for command execution
- System integrity protection mechanisms

## IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK
