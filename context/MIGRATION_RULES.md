# MIGRATION_RULES.md - System Evolution and Content Migration Authority

**30/07/2025 12:15 CDMX** | Systematic migration protocols with authority preservation

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
TRUTH_SOURCE.md → MIGRATION_RULES.md implements systematic evolution per user vision

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Preserve user authority + Systematic evolution + Zero information loss"** - All system evolution preserves user voice while enabling systematic improvement through evidence-based migration.

## CORE MIGRATION PROTOCOLS

### **L1-CORE: Ultra-Consolidation Migration**

#### **Fragmented → Consolidated Migration Protocol**
```
Phase 1: Content Analysis
├─ Identify all fragmented content with shared domain
├─ Extract user quotes and authority statements
├─ Map cross-references and dependencies
└─ Validate complete content inventory

Phase 2: Authority Consolidation
├─ Create single authoritative source file
├─ Preserve ALL user quotes with line-specific references
├─ Maintain authority chain hierarchy
└─ Implement quote-based fragmentation for complex content

Phase 3: Reference Architecture Implementation
├─ Create reference-only files pointing to consolidated source
├─ Update all existing cross-references
├─ Implement bidirectional linking system
└─ Validate zero content duplication

Phase 4: Validation and Testing
├─ Verify 95%+ user voice fidelity preservation
├─ Test all reference pathways and loading
├─ Validate authority chain integrity
└─ Confirm zero functionality loss
```

#### **Evidence-Based Consolidation Criteria**
```
Consolidation Triggers:

└─ Update active system references to point to archive

Phase 4: Validation and Access
├─ Test archive access and reference integrity
├─ Validate historical authority preservation
├─ Confirm operational context updates
└─ Verify user authority acknowledgment of archival
```

#### **Archive Migration Criteria**
```
Archive Triggers:

```

### **Authority Conflict Resolution During Migration**

#### **Migration Authority Conflicts**
```
Conflict Resolution Protocol:
