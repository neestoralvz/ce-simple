# Validation Protocols - Research Quality Assurance

**30/07/2025 17:15 CDMX** | Research validation protocols and quality gates

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/architecture/templates/research-documentation-template.md → validation-protocols/ implements validation frameworks per research template authority

## RESEARCH QUALITY VALIDATION

### **Research Validation Framework**
```markdown
## RESEARCH VALIDATION

### Methodology Validation
- ✅ Multiple information sources consulted
- ✅ Performance data verified across sources
- ✅ Think x4 systematic analysis applied
- ✅ Evidence-based conclusions with source backing

### Bias Check
- **[Bias Type 1]**: [How bias was avoided or accounted for]
- **[Bias Type 2]**: [How bias was avoided or accounted for]
- **[Perspective Balance]**: [How multiple viewpoints were considered]

### Research Quality Metrics
- **Source Diversity**: [Range of sources consulted]
- **Analysis Depth**: [Levels of systematic evaluation]
- **Practical Focus**: [Real-world implementation consideration]
```

## QUALITY GATES

### **Minimum Research Standards**
- **Sources**: Minimum 3 credible sources per major option
- **Analysis Depth**: Complete Think x4 framework applied
- **Evidence**: All claims backed by verifiable sources
- **Bias Check**: Explicit bias identification and mitigation
- **Practical Focus**: Real-world implementation considerations addressed

### **Documentation Completeness Checklist**
- [ ] Research methodology clearly documented
- [ ] All options comprehensively analyzed
- [ ] Think x4 systematic analysis completed
- [ ] Evidence and sources properly documented
- [ ] Quality validation performed
- [ ] Comparison matrix created
- [ ] Implementation strategy documented
- [ ] Success metrics defined

### **Review & Validation Protocol**
1. **Self-Review**: Researcher validates completeness against template
2. **Peer Review**: Secondary review for bias and quality
3. **Authority Validation**: Alignment with project standards and vision
4. **Implementation Readiness**: All necessary information for decision-making present

## TEMPLATE USAGE PROTOCOL

### **When to Use This Template**
- **Technical Decision Points**: Choosing between implementation approaches
- **System Architecture Decisions**: Major structural choices
- **Tool/Technology Evaluation**: Comparing options for adoption
- **Process Improvement**: Evaluating workflow or methodology changes

### **Template Customization Guidelines**
- **Maintain Core Structure**: All mandatory sections must be present
- **Adapt Think x4 Perspectives**: Customize to investigation topic
- **Scale Evidence Requirements**: Adjust based on decision importance
- **Preserve Quality Gates**: All validation requirements mandatory
