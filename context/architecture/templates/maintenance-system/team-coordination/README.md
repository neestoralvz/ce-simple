**30/07/2025 17:15 CDMX** | README maintenance team coordination and workflow protocols

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/architecture/templates/README_maintenance_system_overview.md → team-coordination/ implements team coordination per maintenance system authority

## TEAM COORDINATION FRAMEWORK

### **Team Roles and Responsibilities**
```markdown
README Maintenance Team Coordination:
├─ **System Administrators** → Daily operations using README_system_maintenance.md
├─ **Evolution Managers** → System growth using README_evolution_protocol.md (Navigation Hub + specialized domains)  
├─ **Problem Resolution Specialists** → Issue resolution using README_troubleshooting_guide.md
├─ **Integration Coordinators** → System coordination using README_integration_maintenance.md
└─ **Quality Assurance Teams** → Quality management using README_quality_monitoring.md
```

## MAINTENANCE WORKFLOW COORDINATION

### **Coordinated Maintenance Execution**
```markdown
Coordinated Maintenance Execution:
1. **Daily Operations Team** → Execute maintenance protocols and identify issues
2. **Quality Monitoring Team** → Analyze metrics and identify improvement opportunities
3. **Problem Resolution Team** → Address identified issues using troubleshooting guides
4. **Integration Team** → Coordinate system integration point optimization
5. **Evolution Team** → Plan and implement system evolution based on growth patterns
```

## SYSTEM LEARNING INTEGRATION

### **Usage Pattern Learning**
```markdown
README System Learning Framework:
├─ **Usage Pattern Learning** → System adapts based on actual usage patterns
├─ **Issue Pattern Recognition** → Preventive measures based on common issues
├─ **Quality Trend Analysis** → Optimization based on quality metric trends
├─ **Evolution Pattern Integration** → System evolution based on organic growth patterns
└─ **User Feedback Integration** → System improvement based on user experience data
```

## KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION PROTOCOL

### **Maintenance Knowledge Integration**
```markdown
Maintenance Knowledge Integration:
├─ **Issue Resolution Learning** → Troubleshooting improvements based on resolved issues
├─ **Quality Improvement Learning** → Enhancement patterns based on successful improvements
├─ **Evolution Success Learning** → Evolution protocol improvement based on successful changes
├─ **Integration Optimization Learning** → Integration improvements based on coordination success
└─ **System Resilience Learning** → Prevention improvements based on emergency recovery experience
```

## AUTHORITY PRESERVATION

### **Team Authority Framework**
```markdown
Authority Preservation Across All Maintenance Operations:
├─ **User Authority Supremacy** → All maintenance serves user vision fulfillment
├─ **Authority Chain Integrity** → Every operation validates authority preservation
├─ **Domain Boundary Respect** → Maintenance operations respect authority domains
├─ **Vision Alignment** → System evolution aligned with user vision discovery
└─ **Organic Growth Support** → Maintenance enables rather than restricts evolution
```
