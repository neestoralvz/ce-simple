# Action Command Template - Direct Execution Commands

**31/07/2025 CDMX** | Template for /actions: direct execution commands

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/architecture/templates/universal-template-structure.md â†’ action-command-template.md implements action structure per template authority

## ACTION COMMAND STRUCTURE

### Template Framework
```markdown
# /actions:name - [Action Function]

**DD/MM/YYYY** | [Action purpose]

## DO
- [Primary action execution 1]
- [Primary action execution 2]
- [When to EXECUTE /methodology:specific]
- [Quality/completion criteria]

## DON'T
- [Action scope violation 1]
- [Action scope violation 2]
- [Common execution mistakes to avoid]
- [Anti-patterns that compromise action quality]

## Context
- [Templates/patterns relevant to this action]
- [Authority sources for action requirements]
- [Related system components affected by action]

## Next Action
- **Automatic**: /next:command (when action completion triggers clear next step)
- **Recommended**: /suggested:command (when user choice optimal)
- **Context**: Orchestrator continuation vs direct user guidance
```

## ACTION CATEGORIES

### Creation Actions (docs, write)
**DO Pattern**:
- Apply appropriate templates and consistency standards
- Reference authority sources and maintain traceability
- Ensure output meets established quality criteria

**DON'T Pattern**:
- Create content without understanding target audience/purpose
- Duplicate existing information without adding clear value
- Skip template compliance or quality validation

### Processing Actions (compact, expand, research)
**DO Pattern**:  
- Preserve essential information during transformation
- Apply systematic methodology for processing
- Validate transformation quality and completeness

**DON'T Pattern**:
- Process without clear transformation criteria
- Lose critical information during processing operations
- Skip methodology when complexity requires systematic approach

### System Actions (git, maintain)
**DO Pattern**:
- Follow established system protocols and safety checks
- Validate system state before and after action execution
- Document changes appropriately for future reference

**DON'T Pattern**:
- Execute system changes without proper validation
- Skip documentation of system modifications
- Compromise system integrity for convenience
