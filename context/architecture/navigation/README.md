# Navigation - Context System Navigation Intelligence

**30/07/2025 21:30 CDMX** | Comprehensive navigation protocols and pathway guidance

## PURPOSE
Complete navigation intelligence for context system including quick start guides, authority hierarchy, and system behavior protocols.

## NAVIGATION INTELLIGENCE

### Quick Start Navigation Protocols
**"I need to understand the system"**: @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → vision_foundation.md pathway
**"I want to implement something"**: methodology.md → templates.md → standards.md workflow
**"I need architectural decisions"**: authority.md → architecture/ → decision validation
**"I want patterns and examples"**: architecture/patterns/ → templates.md → implementation guidance

### Authority Hierarchy Implementation
```
VISION.md (supreme user authority) → context/vision/vision_foundation.md → 
@context/architecture/core/truth-source.md (architecture dispatcher) → Core Components → 
Specialized Directories → Implementation
```

### Context Loading Intelligence
**Core Always Loaded**: vision_foundation.md, @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md, authority.md, methodology.md, simplicity.md
**Conditional Loading**: Based on semantic triggers and task patterns per CLAUDE.md dispatcher
**Reference-Only Architecture**: Zero content duplication with smart references preserving token economy

### Navigation Pathways Protocol
**Vision Discovery**: User conversation → vision_foundation.md → @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → context → implementation
**Implementation Workflow**: Requirements → methodology.md → patterns → templates.md → standards.md → execution
**Architecture Decisions**: Structural need → authority.md → architecture/ → decision validation → implementation  
**Research Protocol**: Investigation → methodology.md research-first protocol → findings integration

## SYSTEM INTEGRATION PROTOCOLS

### CLAUDE.md Integration
Context system serves as intelligence backend for semantic triggers and decision logic with conversation-first approach.

### Command System Connection
All `.claude/commands/` reference context system for authority, methodology, and template guidance through systematic integration.

### Evolution Protocol Implementation
**Adaptation Triggers**: Vision discovery, architecture needs, usage patterns, quality improvements
**Growth Management**: Semantic placement + modular expansion + legacy preservation + vision alignment validation

## INTEGRATION REFERENCES

### ← context/README.md
**Connection**: Navigation intelligence extracted from main README per L2-MODULAR methodology
**Protocol**: README maintains reference-only navigation hub pointing to specialized navigation intelligence

### ←→ @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md  
**Connection**: Navigation serves @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md dispatcher functionality through pathway implementation
**Protocol**: Navigation intelligence supports semantic trigger routing and context loading protocols
