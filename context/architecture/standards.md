# System Standards Reference Hub

**30/07/2025 04:30 CDMX** | Comprehensive standards consolidation under user authority

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
VISION.md → supreme user authority → @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → STANDARDS.md enforces comprehensive compliance

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"User standards authority preservation through comprehensive enforcement architecture"** - All system standards serve user vision while maintaining complete functionality.

## CORE STANDARDS FRAMEWORK

### **LLM Enforcement Authority (FUNDAMENTAL)**
**LLM Enforcement Principle**: → @context/architecture/core/llm-enforcement-principle.md
**Core Enforcement**: → @context/architecture/standards/llm-enforcement-standards.md

### **Documentation & Style Authority**
**Documentation Standards**: → @context/architecture/standards/documentation-standards.md
**Style Guidelines**: → @context/architecture/standards/style-guidelines.md

### **Behavioral Enforcement Authority**
**Enforcement Standards**: → @context/architecture/standards/enforcement-standards.md
**Quality Gates**: → @context/architecture/standards/quality-gates.md

### **Technical Implementation Authority**
**Technical Standards**: → @context/architecture/standards/technical-standards.md
**Claude Code Integration**: → @context/architecture/standards/claude-code-integration.md

### **Visual Communication Authority**
**Visual Standards**: → @context/architecture/standards/visual-standards.md
**Plan Notification Standards**: → @context/architecture/ux/plan-notification-standards.md

### **Structural Integrity Authority**
**Structural Standards**: → @context/architecture/standards/structural-standards.md
**Guardian-Partner System**: → @context/architecture/standards/guardian-partner-system.md

## INTEGRATED ENFORCEMENT ARCHITECTURE

### **Complete Standards Authority**
**Authority Chain**: VISION.md → @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → STANDARDS.md → specialized standards
**Methodology Integration**: → @context/architecture/standards/methodology-integration.md
**Quality Assurance**: → @context/architecture/standards/quality-assurance.md

## INTEGRATION REFERENCES

**Protocol**: Think x4 + Research-First + Continuous Execution standards compliance

### ←→ @context/vision/simplicity.md
**Connection**: Standards serve user simplicity philosophy with information density preservation
**Protocol**: "Information density over structural optimization" per user explicit authority

**STANDARDS ARCHITECTURE DECLARATION**: Complete standards framework implementing user vision through specialized modules while preserving comprehensive enforcement capability and complete authority chain integrity.

**EVOLUTION PATHWAY**: Standards evolve through VISION.md → conversation → specialized standards → systematic compliance cycle.
