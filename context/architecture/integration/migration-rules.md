# MIGRATION_RULES.md - System Evolution Authority Hub

**30/07/2025 12:15 CDMX** | Systematic migration navigation with authority preservation

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → MIGRATION_RULES.md implements systematic evolution per user vision

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Preserve user authority + Systematic evolution + Zero information loss"** - All system evolution preserves user voice while enabling systematic improvement through evidence-based migration.

## MIGRATION SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### **L1-CORE: Ultra-Consolidation Protocol**
- **Fragmented to Consolidated**: Multiple files consolidated into single authoritative sources
- **Authority Preservation**: Complete user voice fidelity (95%+ requirement) through exact quote maintenance
- **Information Density**: Zero content loss during consolidation process
- **Reference Integration**: Bidirectional linking system implementation

### **L2-MODULAR: Specialized Extraction Protocol**
- **Consolidated to Modular**: Large files factorized into specialized components ≤80 lines
- **Modular Independence**: Each module self-contained with precise cross-references
- **Authority Chain**: Complete traceability to supreme authority sources maintained
- **Functionality Preservation**: 100% functionality maintained through reference architecture

### **L3-ARCHIVE: Historical Preservation Protocol**
- **Active to Archive**: Superseded components preserved with complete historical context
- **Legacy Documentation**: Decision rationale and migration pathways documented
- **Knowledge Continuity**: Historical intelligence feeds into active system evolution
- **Recovery Capability**: Complete system recovery possible from archived components

### **L4-VALIDATION: Quality Assurance Protocol**
- **Pre-Migration**: Authority validation, functionality verification, backup creation
- **Mid-Migration**: Progressive validation, reference integrity, authority preservation
- **Post-Migration**: Complete functionality testing, authority chain validation, quality assessment
- **Rollback Capability**: Complete migration reversal if validation fails

### **Migration Execution Framework**
- **Authority Preservation Protocols**: User voice fidelity and supreme authority validation throughout migration
- **Consolidation Criteria**: Evidence-based triggers and measurable success metrics
- **Reference Architecture**: Bidirectional linking and cross-reference migration protocols
- **Quality Gates**: Comprehensive pre/mid/post migration validation and testing frameworks

## MIGRATION EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### **Migration Pathway Access**
1. **Ultra-Consolidation** → L1-CORE protocol for fragmented to consolidated migration
2. **Modular Extraction** → L2-MODULAR protocol for consolidated to specialized modules
3. **Archive Preservation** → L3-ARCHIVE protocol for active to historical preservation
4. **Quality Validation** → L4-VALIDATION protocol for systematic validation framework

### **Authority Preservation Framework**
- **User Voice Fidelity**: 95%+ preservation requirement through all migration phases
- **Authority Chain Integrity**: Complete traceability to supreme authority sources maintained
- **Zero Information Loss**: All content preserved through modular extraction and reference architecture
- **Evolution Compatibility**: Organic growth supported through migration design

## MIGRATION INTELLIGENCE

### **Entry Points**
- **System Evolution**: ← @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md (context dispatcher authority)
- **Architecture Changes**: ← @architecture/ (architectural decision migration)
- **Standards Evolution**: ← @standards.md (compliance migration protocols)

### **Migration Pathways**
- **Protocol Execution**: L1-L4 migration protocol implementation and execution
- **Authority Validation**: Authority preservation and user voice fidelity protocols
- **Quality Assurance**: Pre/mid/post migration validation and testing frameworks

### **Integration References**
- **Cross-Reference System**: ←→ @architecture/integration/cross-reference-system.md (reference migration protocols)
- **Component Decision Matrix**: ←→ @architecture/integration/component-decision-matrix.md (integration migration)
- **Authority Framework**: ← @architecture/core/authority.md (migration authority validation)

**MIGRATION RULES DECLARATION**: This systematic migration hub implements user vision of authority preservation through evidence-based system evolution via specialized migration modules preserving complete functionality.

**EVOLUTION PATHWAY**: Migration rules evolve through usage → validation → systematic improvement cycle preserving user authority supremacy.
