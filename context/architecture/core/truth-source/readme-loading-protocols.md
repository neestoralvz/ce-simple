# README Loading Protocols - Dynamic Context Intelligence

**31/07/2025 CDMX** | Extracted from truth-source.md L2-MODULAR processing

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → readme-loading-protocols.md implements dynamic README loading authority

## DYNAMIC README LOADING PROTOCOLS

### Progressive Context Disclosure Intelligence
**Phase-Based Loading**: Primary README → Secondary README → Authority README → Integration README based on conversation complexity
**Context Depth Management**: Simple conversation = Primary only, Complex conversation = Full README chain + @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md validation
**Authority Preservation**: All README navigation maintains supreme authority chain integrity

### Conversation-Driven README Routing
**Semantic Pattern Recognition** → Automatic README identification → Progressive disclosure → Specialized component access
**Natural Language Processing** → Intent detection → Domain-specific README loading → Context-aware component activation
**Authority Chain Validation** → README authority verification → Supreme authority compliance → Implementation guidance

### README Integration Framework
**Context Intelligence**: README navigation serves conversation-first development through intelligent component connectivity
**Progressive Enhancement**: Context loading adapts to conversation depth and complexity requirements
**Authority Supremacy**: All README routing preserves user authority through systematic validation protocols
