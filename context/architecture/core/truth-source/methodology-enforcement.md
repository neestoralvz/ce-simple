# Methodology Enforcement - Integrated Authority Validation

**31/07/2025 CDMX** | Extracted from truth-source.md L2-MODULAR processing

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → methodology-enforcement.md implements methodology enforcement authority

## METODOLOGÍA ENFORCEMENT INTEGRADA

### Reference-Only Content Protocol
**OBLIGATORIO**: No content duplication - only conditional references
**ANTI-MONOLITHIC**: File size ≤80 lines enforcement
**CONTEXT EFFICIENCY**: Token economy through reference system
**DRY COMPLIANCE**: Single source of truth + smart references system

### Software Engineering Principles Integration
**DRY ENFORCEMENT**: No content duplication across context modules
**SOLID COMPLIANCE**: Single responsibility + dependency inversion for context loading
**COGNITIVE LOAD MANAGEMENT**: Progressive disclosure + contextual information loading
**ANTI-DUPLICATION**: Automatic detection + prevention of redundant structures

### Authority Chain Validation
**SUPREME AUTHORITY**: This dispatcher → specialized context modules → implementation
**HIERARCHICAL ENFORCEMENT**: Authority preserved through reference structure
**VALIDATION MANDATE**: All decisions traced to specialized context ownership

### Conversation Preservation Protocol
**MANDATORY PROTECTION**: Conversations cannot be eliminated unless fully processed
**Processing Criteria**:
- Key insights extracted to operational/ or @context/archive/legacy/user-vision-layers/
- Architectural decisions documented in @context/architecture/patterns/
- User confirmation of processing completeness
**ELIMINATION AUTHORITY**: USER ONLY after explicit processing verification
**PARTNER ENFORCEMENT**: Challenge system MUST activate on archive operations
