# Component Lifecycle Management - Archive Intelligence Authority

**30/07/2025 09:25 CDMX** | Component lifecycle methodology extracted from methodology.md per L2-MODULAR protocol

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/architecture/core/methodology.md → component-lifecycle-management.md implements lifecycle methodology per user vision

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Systematic Obsolescence Assessment: 4-phase evidence-based evaluation for component continued utility vs archiving necessity"** - Intelligence-driven lifecycle management preserving value while eliminating obsolescence.

## 4-PHASE LIFECYCLE FRAMEWORK (ADR-028)

### Phase 1: Utility Assessment
**Current Usage Analysis**: Systematic analysis of component usage patterns and frequency
**Value Contribution Evaluation**: Assessment of component contribution to system functionality
**Dependency Impact Assessment**: Analysis of component dependencies and interconnections
**Performance Impact Measurement**: Quantitative assessment of component system performance impact

### Phase 2: Obsolescence Evaluation
**Functional Redundancy Analysis**: Identification of functional overlap with other components
**Technology Currency Assessment**: Evaluation of component technology relevance and currency
**Maintenance Cost Analysis**: Assessment of maintenance overhead vs delivered value
**Evolution Compatibility Review**: Analysis of component compatibility with system evolution

### Phase 3: Archive Decision Protocol
**Evidence-Based Decision Making**: Systematic evaluation based on quantitative evidence
**Authority Validation**: User authority confirmation for significant architectural changes
**Impact Mitigation Planning**: Complete planning for dependency resolution and migration
**Rollback Preparation**: Preparation for potential decision reversal if needed

### Phase 4: Archive-with-Intelligence Implementation
**Historical Intelligence Preservation**: Complete preservation of component intelligence and learning
**95%+ Authority Fidelity**: Preservation of user voice and authority through systematic archiving
**Learning Integration**: Integration of component lessons into system knowledge base
**Template Extraction**: Extraction of reusable patterns before archiving

## ARCHIVE-WITH-INTELLIGENCE PROTOCOL

### Intelligence Preservation Framework
**Complete Context Preservation**: Full context and rationale preservation during archiving
**Authority Voice Fidelity**: 95%+ user authority preservation through systematic documentation
**Learning Extraction**: Systematic extraction of valuable patterns and insights
**Knowledge Integration**: Integration of component intelligence into system knowledge base

### TodoWrite-Tracked Decision Making
**Process Transparency**: Complete transparency for complex architectural decisions
**Systematic Completion Tracking**: TodoWrite integration for systematic decision process tracking
**Decision Validation**: Systematic validation of decision completeness and quality
**Authority Confirmation**: User authority confirmation throughout decision process

## CASE STUDY VALIDATION

### Handoff System Success Framework
**Zero Functionality Loss**: Handoff system archiving demonstrated complete functionality preservation
**Complete Authority Preservation**: User authority maintained throughout archiving process
**Intelligence Integration**: Handoff intelligence successfully integrated into system knowledge
**Template Creation**: Reusable archiving templates created from successful case study

### Validated Success Criteria
**Functionality Preservation**: Complete system functionality maintained through archiving
**Authority Integrity**: User authority supremacy preserved throughout lifecycle management
**Intelligence Utilization**: Archived intelligence successfully integrated into system capability
**Process Replication**: Lifecycle management process successfully replicated across components

## AUTHORITY INTEGRATION

**Hub Authority**: ← @context/architecture/core/methodology.md (methodology hub authority)
**ADR Integration**: ←→ @context/architecture/adr/ADR-028-component-lifecycle-management.md (decision framework)
**Authority Preservation**: All lifecycle decisions serve user authority supremacy through systematic evaluation

---

**LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT DECLARATION**: This framework implements systematic component lifecycle management preserving complete intelligence and authority while enabling evidence-based archiving through validated protocols.

**EVOLUTION PATHWAY**: Component assessment → evidence evaluation → systematic archiving → intelligence preservation
