**31/07/2025 CDMX** | Implementation timing extracted from evidence-based-implementation.md

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/architecture/core/methodology/evidence-based-implementation.md → implementation-timing-protocol.md implements timing protocol

## IMPLEMENTATION TIMING PROTOCOL

### Decision Momentum Preservation
**Immediate Post-Research Execution**: Implementation immediately follows research completion
**Scope Creep Prevention**: Immediate execution prevents requirement drift and scope expansion
**Decision Clarity Maintenance**: Clear decision implementation before context degradation
**Momentum Optimization**: Research-to-implementation momentum preservation for success

### Timing Success Factors
**Context Preservation**: Implementation context maintained through immediate execution
**Decision Fidelity**: Research decisions implemented with complete fidelity
**Quality Maintenance**: Quality standards maintained through immediate systematic implementation
**Success Replication**: Timing patterns replicated for consistent success achievement

## TIMING OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK

### Immediate Execution Protocol
1. **Research Completion** → Immediate transition to implementation phase
2. **Context Preservation** → Implementation context maintained without degradation
3. **Decision Implementation** → Research decisions executed with complete fidelity
4. **Momentum Maintenance** → Success momentum preserved throughout execution

### Success Pattern Replication
**Timing Pattern Recognition**: Identification of successful timing patterns for replication
**Context Degradation Prevention**: Immediate execution preventing decision context loss
**Quality Standard Maintenance**: Systematic quality preservation through timing optimization
**Success Achievement Consistency**: Consistent success through timing pattern replication
