# Quality Gates Implementation - Systematic Validation Authority

**30/07/2025 CDMX** | Quality gates implementation with systematic validation protocols

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
← critical_violations_action_plan.md → quality gates implementation serves systematic validation per remediation authority

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Quality gates validation preserving user authority supremacy"** - All validation gates validate remediation quality while maintaining authority chain integrity.

## PRE-REMEDIATION QUALITY GATES

```
PRE_REMEDIATION_VALIDATION:
├── COMPLETE_CONTENT_INVENTORY: Map all user authority content before extraction
├── AUTHORITY_CHAIN_ANALYSIS: Document complete authority hierarchy for preservation
├── CROSS_REFERENCE_MAPPING: Identify all bidirectional links requiring updates
└── USER_QUOTE_IDENTIFICATION: Catalog all user quotes for 95%+ fidelity preservation
```

### Pre-Remediation Validation Framework
- **Content Inventory**: Complete mapping of all content before modular extraction
- **Authority Chain Documentation**: Full hierarchy documentation for preservation
- **Cross-Reference Analysis**: All bidirectional links identified and mapped
- **User Quote Cataloging**: All user quotes identified for fidelity preservation

## MID-REMEDIATION QUALITY GATES

```
MID_REMEDIATION_MONITORING:
├── AUTHORITY_PRESERVATION_TRACKING: Real-time user voice fidelity measurement
├── REFERENCE_INTEGRITY_VALIDATION: Bidirectional link consistency monitoring
├── MODULAR_FUNCTIONALITY_TESTING: Progressive disclosure + navigation testing
└── COGNITIVE_LOAD_OPTIMIZATION: Information accessibility validation
```

### Mid-Remediation Monitoring Framework
- **Authority Preservation**: Real-time monitoring of user voice fidelity during extraction
- **Reference Integrity**: Continuous validation of bidirectional link consistency
- **Functionality Testing**: Progressive disclosure and navigation validation
- **Cognitive Load Management**: Information accessibility optimization validation

## POST-REMEDIATION QUALITY GATES

```
POST_REMEDIATION_VALIDATION:
├── SIZE_COMPLIANCE_VERIFICATION: 100% files ≤80 lines mandatory
├── AUTHORITY_CHAIN_INTEGRITY: Complete traceability to user authority sources
├── FUNCTIONALITY_PRESERVATION: Zero functionality loss confirmed
├── USER_SATISFACTION_VALIDATION: Information density maintained through modular access
└── EVOLUTION_READINESS: Organic growth compatibility confirmed
```

### Post-Remediation Validation Framework
- **Size Compliance**: 100% compliance with ≤80 line requirement verification
- **Authority Chain Integrity**: Complete traceability to user authority sources
- **Functionality Preservation**: Zero functionality loss through comprehensive testing
- **User Satisfaction**: Information density preservation through modular architecture
- **Evolution Readiness**: Organic growth compatibility confirmation

## QUALITY ASSURANCE METHODOLOGY

### Validation Quality Standards
- **Pre-Phase**: Complete preparation and mapping before remediation begins
- **Mid-Phase**: Continuous monitoring and validation during remediation process
- **Post-Phase**: Comprehensive verification and quality confirmation after completion
- **System Integration**: Full system validation and evolution readiness confirmation
