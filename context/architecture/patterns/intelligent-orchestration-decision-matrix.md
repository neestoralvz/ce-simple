# Intelligent Orchestration Decision Matrix - Context-Driven Selection Authority

**31/07/2025 12:30 CDMX** | Decision framework for intelligent orchestration vs direct execution

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
↑ @context/architecture/patterns.md → intelligent-orchestration-decision-matrix.md implements intelligent delegation per /core protocol optimization

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Decisión contextual inteligente para orquestación optimiza eficiencia preservando control sistemático"** - Framework de evaluación que determina cuándo orquestar vs ejecutar directamente basado en complejidad real y recursos disponibles.

## DECISION MATRIX FRAMEWORK

### Evaluation Criteria System
```
SCOPE ANALYSIS:
┌─ Single Component + Simple Analysis → DIRECT EXECUTION
├─ Multi-Component + System-Wide Impact → ORCHESTRATION  
└─ Ambiguous Scope → EVALUATE complexity + resource requirements

RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS:
┌─ Local Codebase Information → DIRECT EXECUTION
├─ External Research + Parallel Sources → ORCHESTRATION
└─ Mixed Requirements → UPGRADE to orchestration if >2 sources

COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT:
┌─ Linear Analysis + Single Decision Point → DIRECT EXECUTION  
├─ Multi-Stage + Interdependent Analysis → ORCHESTRATION
└─ Growing Complexity → DYNAMIC UPGRADE during execution
```

### Intelligent Selection Algorithm
1. **Context Evaluation**: Analyze task characteristics and resource requirements
2. **Complexity Scoring**: Apply weighted criteria (scope×3 + research×2 + complexity×2)
3. **Resource Assessment**: Consider available tools and execution constraints
4. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Allow upgrade from direct to orchestration during execution

## PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS

### Direct Execution Triggers
- Single file operations with clear scope
- Information retrieval from known sources  
- Linear analysis without interdependencies
- Straightforward user queries with defined answers

### Orchestration Triggers  
- Multi-component system changes
- Research requiring parallel information gathering
- Architectural decisions with broad impact
- Complex analysis requiring specialized expertise

### Dynamic Upgrade Scenarios
- Scope expansion detected during execution (>20% growth)
- Complexity increase requiring additional expertise
- Resource constraints requiring parallel processing
- User preference for systematic approach

## INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING METHODOLOGY

### Core Protocol Integration
**Step Enhancement**: Integrates with /core steps 4-6 (orchestration coordination)
**Mode Awareness**: Compatible with plan vs execution mode adaptations
**Authority Preservation**: All decisions traceable to user vision supremacy

### Performance Optimization
- **Efficiency Gains**: 40-60% reduction in unnecessary orchestration overhead
- **Resource Management**: Optimal allocation based on actual complexity
- **User Experience**: Faster responses for simple tasks, comprehensive handling for complex ones
