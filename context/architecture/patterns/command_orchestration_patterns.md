# Command Orchestration Patterns - Matrix Coordination Authority

**30/07/2025 16:30 CDMX** | Universal command framework with intelligent coordination

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
↑ @context/architecture/patterns.md → command_orchestration_patterns.md implements matrix coordination per user vision

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"los comandos son autocontenidos entre ellos y solo pueden conectarse con otros comandos"**

## COMMAND INDEPENDENCE ARCHITECTURE

### Matrix Core Behavior
**Commands maintain independence but coordinate intelligently based on context**

### Self-Containment Rules
- Commands self-contained within commands/ folder
- No external file dependencies allowed
- Inter-command communication through defined interfaces only
- Validate command isolation before execution

### Universal Framework
**Dynamic Adaptation**: Options evolve with system capabilities
**Context Intelligence**: System understands implicit context requirements

## ORCHESTRATION COORDINATION PROTOCOL

### Subagent Orchestration Authority
**Main Agent**: ALWAYS orchestrate through specialized subagents
**Method**: Task analysis → Template selection → Deployment → Coordination → Integration

### Matrix Interaction Patterns
**Universal Entry Hub**:
- Analyze context automatically
- Route to specialized commands via Task tool delegation
- Maintain orchestration oversight during execution
- Adapt options dynamically based on specialization patterns

### Command Chain Coordination
**Multi-Command Sequences**: Preserve context → Handle data transfer → Manage execution flow → Validate completion

## ROLE ECOSYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Guardian-Partner Integration
**Partner (Constructor)**: Socratic methodology challenges, explores alternatives
**Guardian (Enforcer)**: Binary compliance validation, "no mercy" enforcement
**Orchestrator**: Coordinates both roles based on context requirements

### Guardian Activation Triggers
**Auto-activation**: File size violations (>80 lines) + Authority breaches + Vision modifications + Standards non-compliance

## UNIVERSAL COMMAND INTEGRATION

### Context-Aware Command Routing
**Dynamic Protocol**: Options evolve with capabilities + Command availability drives interface + Context intelligence determines relevance

### Decision Tree Integration
**Embedded**: Trigger conditions → Context routing → Exit conditions → Efficiency metrics
