## HANDOFF CREATION PROTOCOL

### Creation Workflow Framework
```
Complex Issue → Criteria Assessment → Meets 3+ Criteria → Handoff Creation
     ↓                 ↓                    ↓                    ↓
  Identified      5-Point Analysis    Promotion Decision    Structured Handoff
   (#35, #27)     (Quantitative)      (Data-Driven)       (Dashboard Integration)
```
