# Pattern Recognition Framework - L2-MODULAR Candidate Assessment

**31/07/2025 00:00 CDMX** | Systematic framework for identifying L2-MODULAR extraction candidates

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
↑ @context/architecture/patterns/l2-modular-extraction-patterns.md → pattern-recognition-framework.md implements systematic candidate identification per extraction methodology

## PATTERN RECOGNITION FRAMEWORK

### L2-MODULAR Candidate Identification Protocol
**Size-Based Triggers**:
- **Primary Candidates**: >200 lines (systematic extraction recommended)
- **Secondary Candidates**: 120-200 lines with multiple domain content
- **Content Structure**: Files with clear subsection organization and hierarchical information

**Content Analysis Criteria**:
- **Multi-Domain Content**: Files covering multiple distinct topics/domains
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Clear section structures amenable to module extraction
- **Authority Concentration**: Central authority files with extensive user quotes and frameworks
- **Cross-Reference Density**: Files with high incoming/outgoing reference counts

### vs Content Optimization Decision Matrix
```
L2-MODULAR Extraction When:
├── File Size: >200 lines OR 120-200 with complex structure
├── Content Type: Multi-domain authority hubs with hierarchical organization
├── Reference Density: High cross-reference incoming/outgoing counts
└── Authority Concentration: Significant user quotes and framework content

Content Optimization When:
├── File Size: 80-120 lines with single domain focus
├── Content Type: Streamlined technical or procedural content
├── Structure: Linear organization without clear modular boundaries
└── Authority Type: Specialized technical knowledge without quotes
```
