# Methodology Integration - Core Framework Connection

**31/07/2025 00:00 CDMX** | Integration protocols with existing methodology framework

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
↑ @context/architecture/patterns/l2-modular-extraction-patterns.md → methodology-integration.md implements methodology integration per extraction authority

## INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING METHODOLOGY

### Connection to Core Methodology Framework
**Research-to-Implementation Pipeline Integration**:
- L2-MODULAR extraction serves "Modular implementation" phase
- Evidence-based structure determination drives extraction decisions
- Think x4 analysis applied to extraction strategy selection

**Orchestration Framework Integration**:
- Guardian enforcement triggers for size violations resolve through L2-MODULAR
- Reference architecture supports intelligent context loading
- Module specialization enhances system coordination capabilities

### Evolution Pathway
**Methodology Enhancement**: L2-MODULAR patterns integrate with existing methodology without replacement
**Organic Growth**: Extraction methodology adapts to system evolution needs
**Pattern Refinement**: Success metrics drive continuous pattern optimization
