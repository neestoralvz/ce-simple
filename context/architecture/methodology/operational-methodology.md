# L2-Operational Methodology

**30/07/2025 Factorized** | Specialized operational methodology patterns

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
↑ @context/methodology.md → L2-Operational implementation per core methodology authority

## RESEARCH-FIRST PROTOCOL

### 10-Step Enhanced Research Process
**Request analysis → Temporal validation → Codebase exploration → Internet research → Multi-conversation assessment → Git worktree prep → Planning documentation → Quality gates → Execution → Integration convergence**

**Concurrent Tools OBLIGATORIO**: WebSearch + MCP context7 simultáneamente, batch independent searches, optimize for maximum information density

## EMPIRICAL ELIMINATION INNOVATION

### Revolutionary Principle
**Remove components systematically while testing functionality → reveals true architectural requirements vs theoretical preservation**

**Success Evidence**: 4-8 files provide real value vs 180+ files representing overhead (5% value ratio confirmed through systematic elimination)

**Over-Engineering Detection**: Remove → Test functionality → Measure impact → Essential/Functional/Overhead/Over-engineering classification

## EXECUTION PATTERNS

### TDD Recursive Protocol
**Objective establishment → Success criteria → Implementation loop → Validation cycle → Recursive retry until success**

### Git WorkTree Integration
**Conversation-level branching, experimental control, granular change management, user ultra-orchestrator coordination**

### Quality Gates
**Creation → Alignment → Verification protocol with context/TRUTH_SOURCE.md validation**
