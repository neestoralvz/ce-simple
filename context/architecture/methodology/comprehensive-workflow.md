# L3-Comprehensive Workflow Architecture

**30/07/2025 Factorized** | Specialized comprehensive workflow systems

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
↑ @context/architecture/core/methodology.md → L3-Comprehensive Workflow implementation per core methodology authority

## COMPLETE WORKFLOW SYSTEM

### Discovery & Planning Flow
**Discovery**: Diálogo mayéutico → contexto completo → vision crystallization
**Exploration**: Codebase investigation → Context analysis → Enhanced discovery questions  
**Investigation**: WebSearch + MCP integration → Solution synthesis → Evidence-based suggestions
**Planning**: Think x4 analysis → Step-by-step design → Multi-conversation division → Prompt generation

### Execution & Integration Flow
**Multi-Conversation Execution**: Conversation breakdown → Orchestrator deployment → Subagent coordination → Power multiplication
**Maintenance**: System/Command/Context/Implementation/CLAUDE.md/README/Reference/Directory/Project structure comprehensive
**Closure**: Learning extraction → Context integration → System improvement → Knowledge persistence

## REVOLUTIONARY INTEGRATION PATTERNS

### 4-Phase Ultra-Orchestration
**(1) Unrestricted Socratic Discovery, (2) Research-First Protocol, (3) Multi-Conversation Parallel Execution, (4) Convergent Integration**

### Advanced Integration Techniques
**Background Intelligence**: Persistent processes maintain state between conversations via ticket system communication matrix
**Quote-Based Fragmentation**: User voice preservation during complex splitting (95%+ fidelity through systematic organization)
**Architectural Transformation Mastery**: Phase-based methodology for massive changes (Analysis → Authority Consolidation → Content Organization → Reference Architecture → Implementation)
