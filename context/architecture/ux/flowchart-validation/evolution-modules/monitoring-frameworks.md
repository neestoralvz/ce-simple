# Monitoring Frameworks - System Evolution Tracking & Continuous Improvement

**30/07/2025 CDMX** | System evolution tracking with continuous improvement protocols

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
← evolution-monitoring.md (evolution monitoring authority) → monitoring-frameworks.md implements monitoring frameworks per evolution authority

## SYSTEM EVOLUTION TRACKING

### Architecture Evolution Monitoring
- New component integration tracking, directory structure changes, reference system assessment, standards impact measurement

### Usage Pattern Evolution
- Decision pattern frequency analysis, user behavior adaptation tracking, edge case emergence monitoring, efficiency pattern identification

### Authority Evolution Monitoring
- User vision evolution tracking, authority hierarchy modifications, domain boundary assessment, supreme authority preservation validation

### Performance Evolution Assessment
- Decision speed trend analysis, accuracy improvement tracking, user satisfaction monitoring, system efficiency enhancement measurement

## CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROTOCOL

### Data Collection Framework
- Automated usage metrics collection, user feedback systematic gathering, performance data monitoring, authority compliance tracking

### Analysis and Pattern Recognition
- Statistical analysis of usage patterns, trend identification and significance testing, performance bottleneck identification, user experience pattern analysis

### Improvement Planning & Implementation
- Priority assessment based on impact/effort, authority validation for changes, backward compatibility preservation, implementation strategy development
- Controlled deployment, A/B testing for effectiveness, user acceptance validation, authority preservation verification
