# Performance Metrics - System Impact Assessment

**30/07/2025 18:30 CDMX** | System performance impact assessment and monitoring

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
flowchart-validation-protocol.md → performance-metrics.md implements performance monitoring per UX authority

## PERFORMANCE MONITORING FRAMEWORK

### Decision Time Metrics
**Baseline Metrics (Pre-Flowchart)**:
- Simple: 45-120s, Complex: 180-600s, Authority: 30-90s, Emergency: 300-900s

**Target Metrics (With Flowchart)**:
- Simple: <10s, Complex: <30s, Authority: <15s, Emergency: <5s activation

**Performance Tracking**:
- Real-time monitoring, trend analysis, bottleneck identification, continuous improvement measurement

### Accuracy Metrics
**Accuracy Categories**:
- Correct: Optimal placement per authority/standards
- Acceptable: Correct but suboptimal placement
- Incorrect: Misplaced requiring correction
- Authority Violation: Violating user authority requirements

**Target Accuracy Rates**:
- Standard: >98%, Complex: >95%, Edge cases: >90%, Authority preservation: 100%

**Accuracy Monitoring**:
- Real-time tracking, user feedback integration, trend analysis, improvement identification

### System Efficiency Metrics
**Computational Overhead**:
- Flowchart processing time, memory usage, context loading efficiency, integration pathway performance

**User Experience Impact**:
- Cognitive load reduction, decision confidence improvement, error reduction, learning curve optimization

**System Integration Efficiency**:
- Cross-component navigation, reference system responsiveness, authority validation speed, workflow integration effectiveness

### Quality Metrics
**Authority Preservation Quality**:
- Authority chain integrity: 100%, User voice fidelity: >95%, Conflict resolution: >98%, Supreme authority compliance: 100%

**Standards Compliance Quality**:
- Standards adherence: >99%, Quality gate effectiveness: >95%, Compliance validation: >98%, Evolution adaptation: <24h

**User Satisfaction Quality**:
- User approval: >90%, Flowchart usability: >85%, Decision confidence: >80%, Overall satisfaction: >88%
