# Decision Core - 4-Phase Visual Decision Process

**30/07/2025 CDMX** | Core visual decision process with systematic content placement

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
← visual-decision-system.md (visual decision authority) → decision-core.md implements 4-phase decision process per visual authority

## PHASE 1: Content Classification

```
Content Type Decision Tree:
User Vision Content? → context/vision/
  ├── Philosophy/Discovery → vision_foundation.md
  ├── Vision Evolution → vision/ directory
  └── Vision Crystallization → vision-specific components

Authority Content? → @context/architecture/core/authority.md
  ├── User Authority → authority supremacy principles
  ├── Domain Boundaries → user-AI separation
  └── Authority Chain → hierarchy validation

Technical Content? → context/patterns.md or context/architecture/
  ├── Implementation Patterns → patterns/ directory
  ├── Architecture Decisions → architecture/adr/
  └── UX/Conversation → architecture/ux/

Standards Content? → @context/architecture/standards/README.md
  ├── Documentation Standards → standards/documentation-standards.md
  ├── Enforcement Standards → standards/enforcement-standards.md
  └── Technical Standards → standards/technical-standards.md

Template Content? → context/architecture/templates/
  ├── README Templates → templates/README_template.md
  ├── Component Templates → templates/core_component_template.md
  └── Specialized Templates → templates/specialized_directory_template.md

Data Content? → context/data/
  ├── Performance Data → data/performance/
  ├── Validation Data → data/validation/
  └── Conversation Data → data/conversations/

UX Content? → context/architecture/ux/
  ├── Conversation Patterns → ux/conversation-patterns/
  ├── Interface Design → ux/interface-design/
  └── User Experience → ux/user-experience/
```

## PHASE 2: Authority Validation

```
Authority Source Decision Tree:
User Authority Content?
  ├── Load @context/vision/vision_foundation.md MANDATORY
  ├── Validate against user vision quotes
  ├── Check for vision conflicts → STOP if conflict detected
  └── Continue to placement logic if aligned

System Authority Content?
  ├── Load @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md for validation
  ├── Verify authority chain clarity
  ├── Check hierarchy integrity → ERROR if unclear
  └── Continue with validated authority

Shared Authority Content?
  ├── Load both user and system authority sources
  ├── Design reference architecture for shared access
  ├── Validate bidirectional authority preservation
  └── Continue with reference-based placement
```

## PHASE 3: Placement Logic

```
Content Scope Decision Tree:
Single Component Scope?
  ├── Existing Component? → Edit existing file
  ├── New Component < 80 lines? → Create new file  
  ├── New Component > 80 lines? → Split into modules + references
  └── Validate size compliance and authority preservation

Cross-Component Scope?
  ├── Shared Authority? → Reference architecture approach
  ├── Primary Authority? → Primary component + secondary references
  ├── Integration Required? → Bidirectional reference system
  └── Validate cross-component consistency

System-Wide Scope?
  ├── Place at context/ root level for system authority
  ├── Create comprehensive bidirectional references
  ├── Update @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md and core components
  └── Validate system-wide integration and authority chain
```
