# Visual Frameworks - Final Validation & Success Metrics

**30/07/2025 CDMX** | Visual frameworks with quality gates and success metrics

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
← visual-decision-system.md (visual decision authority) → visual-frameworks.md implements validation frameworks per visual authority

## PHASE 4: Final Validation

```
Quality Gates Validation:
File Size Compliance?
  ├── ≤80 lines? → PASS
  ├── >80 lines? → STOP: Modularize content with reference architecture
  └── Validate modular extraction maintains functionality

Authority Chain Preservation?
  ├── Authority traceable to supreme source? → PASS
  ├── Authority conflicts or gaps? → STOP: Fix authority chain
  └── Validate complete authority integrity through placement

Bidirectional References?
  ├── Forward references implemented? → Check reference accuracy
  ├── Backward references from target components? → STOP: Add cross-references
  └── Validate bidirectional consistency and authority preservation

Standards Compliance?
  ├── Documentation standards met? → Check format and structure
  ├── Technical standards compliance? → Check implementation approach
  ├── Authority standards preserved? → STOP: Apply authority compliance
  └── Validate complete standards adherence before implementation
```

## VISUAL DECISION VALIDATION

### **Decision Confidence Metrics**
- Authority source clarity and validation confidence
- Placement logic consistency and validation accuracy  
- Reference architecture integrity and bidirectional consistency
- Standards compliance verification and quality assurance

### **Decision Success Indicators**
- Placement decision made with clear authority validation
- File size compliance achieved through appropriate modularization
- Reference integrity established with bidirectional consistency
- System integration validated with authority preservation
