## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
placement-methodology/README.md → authority-placement-logic.md implements authority-based placement per methodology authority

## AUTHORITY-BASED PLACEMENT LOGIC

### **Placement Decisions by Authority Type**
- **User Authority**: context/vision/ or @context/architecture/core/authority.md → Vision alignment → Complete voice preservation → Supreme chain maintenance → Supremacy compliance
- **System Authority**: @context/architecture/core/methodology.md or specialized modules → Boundary compliance → Technical accuracy → Supremacy preservation → Framework alignment
- **Shared Authority**: Reference architecture with bidirectional links → User+system compliance → Balance and boundaries → Conflict prevention → Integration effectiveness
- **Authority Conflict**: Temporary placement → Supremacy determination → User supremacy enforcement → Chain repair → Conflict resolution

### **Integration Protocols by Authority**
- **User Authority**: Supreme preservation (overrides all) → Vision-driven integration → Supremacy maintenance → Voice fidelity ≥95%
- **System Authority**: Boundary compliance (within user limits) → Technical accuracy → Efficiency optimization → Never overrides user
- **Shared Authority**: Collaborative (vision + implementation) → Clear boundaries → Appropriate distribution → Proactive conflict prevention
- **Conflict Resolution**: Quick identification → User supremacy enforcement → Systematic resolution → Chain reconstruction

### **Authority Validation Integration**
- **Assessment**: Source identification → Level determination → Boundary analysis → Conflict detection
- **Compliance**: Supremacy check → Chain integrity → Preservation requirements → Contamination prevention
- **Decision**: Placement recommendation → Integration pathways → Quality gates → Preservation activation
- **Documentation**: Source records → Decision rationale → Preservation plans → Validation checkpoints
