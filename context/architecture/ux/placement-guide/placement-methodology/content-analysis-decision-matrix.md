## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
placement-methodology/README.md → content-analysis-decision-matrix.md implements decision synthesis per methodology authority

## DECISION SYNTHESIS FRAMEWORK

### **Analysis Output Structure**
- **Domain Assignment**: Primary domain → Confidence level (High/Medium/Low) → Assignment rationale → Secondary domains
- **Authority Classification**: Authority source (User/System/Shared) → Authority level (Supreme/Primary/Secondary) → Requirements → Conflicts
- **Scope Determination**: Impact scope (Component/Cross-component/System-wide) → Integration complexity → Dependencies → Integration pathways
- **Implementation Requirements**: Size constraints → Quality gates → Reference requirements → Evolution compatibility

### **Confidence Assessment**
- **High Confidence**: Clear single domain → Unambiguous authority → Well-defined scope → Standard requirements
- **Medium Confidence**: Primary domain clear + secondary domains → Authority identified + complexity → Scope defined + considerations → Requirements need attention
- **Low Confidence**: Ambiguous domains/multiple primaries → Unclear/conflicted authority → Unclear scope/system implications → Complex/undefined requirements
- **Improvement Protocol**: Additional analysis (low confidence) → Expert consultation (authority) → Scope research (impact) → Implementation planning (complexity)

### **Decision Validation**
- **Completeness**: Analysis questions addressed → Domain matrix applied → Authority validation complete → Scope assessment comprehensive
- **Logic**: Decision rationale clear → Alternatives considered → Risk assessment complete → Success criteria defined
- **Authority Preservation**: User supremacy maintained → Chain integrity preserved → Conflicts identified/planned → Validation mechanisms established
- **Quality Assurance**: Standards compliance verified → Quality gates identified → Integration requirements validated → Evolution compatibility confirmed
