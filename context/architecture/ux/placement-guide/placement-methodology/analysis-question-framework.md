## SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS QUESTIONS

### **44-Question Analysis Protocol**
- **Q1-4 Domain Purpose**: Primary purpose? → Primary domain? → Secondary domains? → Multiple domain span?
- **Q5-8 Content Function**: Documenting/implementing/governing? → Establishes/follows authority? → User-driven/system-driven? → Modifies existing authority/behavior?
- **Q9-12 Domain Validation**: Alignment with existing? → Domain conflicts/overlaps? → Expansion/modification needed? → Integration with architecture?
- **Q13-16 Authority Source**: Who has authority? → User-exclusive/system-managed? → Authority conflicts/ambiguities? → Modifies existing structures?
- **Q17-20 Authority Impact**: Effect on chains? → Preserves/challenges supremacy? → Preservation requirements? → Framework integration?
- **Q21-24 Authority Validation**: Source traceable/validated? → Requirements clearly defined? → Preserved through placement? → Validation mechanisms needed?
- **Q25-28 Impact Scope**: Impact scope? → Single/multiple components? → System-wide implications? → Integration with existing?
- **Q29-32 Integration Scope**: Integration pathways required? → How many references? → Bidirectional references needed? → Cross-reference complexity?
- **Q33-36 Evolution Scope**: Content evolution over time? → Scalability considerations? → Organic growth support? → Future integration needs?
- **Q37-40 Implementation Complexity**: Size/complexity requirements? → Modular decomposition needed? → Quality gates/validation? → Standards integration?
- **Q41-44 Quality Assurance**: Validation/quality gates? → Quality measurement/maintenance? → Compliance requirements? → Ongoing quality assurance?
