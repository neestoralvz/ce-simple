# Authority Chain Verification - Chain Integrity Validation

**30/07/2025 19:30 CDMX** | Authority chain verification and integrity maintenance

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
placement-methodology/README.md → authority-chain-verification.md implements authority chain validation per methodology authority

## AUTHORITY CHAIN VERIFICATION

### **Chain Traceability Protocol**
- **Supreme Authority**: VISION.md → User supreme authority → @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → Context architecture → Specialized context → Domain authority → Implementation → Compliance
- **Flow Validation**: Authority source → Delegation → Implementation with preservation through levels → Modification tracking → Integrity maintenance
- **Link Verification**: Each link validated → Gaps identified/addressed → Conflicts detected/resolved → Chain completeness confirmed
- **Documentation**: Complete chain mapping → Relationship documentation → Change history tracking → Validation evidence recording

### **Preservation Requirements**
- **User Voice Fidelity**: ≥95% requirement → Exact quote preservation (when possible) → Intent preservation (when paraphrasing) → Supremacy maintenance throughout chain
- **Chain Integrity**: Completeness (no missing links) → Consistency (no contradictions) → Traceability (clear path to source) → Regular integrity checks
- **Contamination Prevention**: Clean sources (no interpretation drift) → Modification tracking → Bias prevention through systematic validation → Clean slate capability
- **Clean Slate Capability**: Authority restoration (contamination detected) → Regeneration protocols → Purity maintenance → Validation reset procedures

### **Validation Checkpoints**
- **Pre-Placement**: Source identification/validation → Chain integrity confirmation → Conflicts detection/resolution → Requirements assessment
- **During-Placement**: Chain maintenance during process → Integrity monitoring throughout → Contamination prevention during modification → Checkpoint execution each step
- **Post-Placement**: Chain integrity confirmation after placement → Preservation effectiveness verification → Contamination detection/remediation → System integration confirmation
- **Ongoing**: Regular integrity assessments → Contamination detection/prevention → Evolution tracking/validation → Restoration procedures when needed
