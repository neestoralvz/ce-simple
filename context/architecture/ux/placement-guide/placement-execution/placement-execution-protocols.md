## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
placement-execution/README.md → placement-execution-protocols.md implements placement execution per execution authority

## PLACEMENT EXECUTION IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK

### **Placement Decision Implementation**
- **Direct Placement**: Single component implementation, clear authority/scope validation, existing directory structure, standard quality gates, no modularization
- **Reference Architecture**: Multi-component integration, reference hub creation, bidirectional references, cross-component coordination, integration pathway establishment
- **Modular Placement**: Content exceeding size limits, L2-MODULAR extraction methodology, reference-only architecture, authority preservation, modular quality gates
- **Emergency Placement**: Urgent requirements, conservative approach, systematic review planning, authority validation scheduling, emergency quality gates

### **Execution Implementation Validation**
- **Immediate Validation**: Location accuracy verification, file creation/modification success, basic integration functionality, authority chain preservation, quality gate passage
- **Integration Validation**: Cross-reference functionality testing, navigation pathway effectiveness, bidirectional consistency, workflow efficiency, cross-component coordination
- **Quality Validation**: Standards compliance, authority preservation effectiveness, file size compliance (≤80 lines), quality gate achievement, protocol compliance
- **User Experience Validation**: User satisfaction assessment, navigation efficiency improvement, decision confidence enhancement, experience improvement validation, workflow integration effectiveness

### **Implementation Success Metrics**
- **Execution Effectiveness**: >95% accuracy, <10 min implementation time, 100% requirement satisfaction, 100% quality gate passage
- **Integration Success**: >98% functional achievement, <5 min integration time, >99% stability rate, <2% maintenance requirement
- **Authority Preservation**: 100% chain integrity, ≥95% user voice preservation, 0% contamination tolerance, 100% validation success
- **User Satisfaction**: >90% approval rate, >85% increased confidence, >75% navigation efficiency improvement, >80% overall experience enhancement
