# Execution Error Handling - Error Resolution Framework

**30/07/2025 19:30 CDMX** | Error detection, resolution, and prevention protocols

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
placement-execution/README.md → execution-error-handling.md implements error handling per execution authority

## ERROR HANDLING FRAMEWORK

### **Error Detection Protocol**
- **Authority Chain Violations**: Source misidentification, chain breaks, contamination, supremacy violations
- **Standards Compliance Failures**: File size violations (>80 lines), reference inconsistencies, quality gate failures
- **Integration Pathway Malfunctions**: Broken references, navigation failures, cross-reference inconsistencies, system malfunctions
- **Quality Gate Failures**: Pre/during/post-implementation validation failures, ongoing maintenance failures

### **Error Resolution Protocol**
- **Immediate Correction**: Error isolation, impact assessment, emergency rollback, immediate implementation
- **Authority Chain Repair**: Source identification, chain reconstruction, integrity restoration, validation system repair
- **Integration Pathway Restoration**: System diagnosis, reference restoration, navigation reconstruction, consistency restoration
- **Quality Gate Remediation**: Failure analysis, compliance restoration, protocol strengthening, system enhancement

### **Error Prevention Protocol**
- **Pre-Execution Validation**: Authority validation, scope determination, decision validation, integration pathway planning
- **Quality Gate Strengthening**: Pre/during/post-implementation validation, ongoing quality maintenance
- **Authority Validation Improvements**: Source identification, chain verification, preservation validation, contamination prevention
- **Integration Testing Enhancement**: Reference system testing, navigation validation, consistency testing, effectiveness validation

### **Error Learning Protocol**
- **Pattern Analysis**: Error pattern identification, root cause analysis, prevention strategy development, pattern prevention
- **Protocol Improvement**: Weakness identification, enhancement based on analysis, validation through prevention, evolution through learning
- **Quality Gate Evolution**: Effectiveness assessment, enhancement based on patterns, validation through prevention, evolution through learning
- **UX Enhancement**: Experience impact assessment, improvement through error reduction, satisfaction enhancement, confidence improvement
