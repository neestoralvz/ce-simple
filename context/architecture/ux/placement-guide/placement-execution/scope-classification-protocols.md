## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
placement-execution/README.md → scope-classification-protocols.md implements scope classification per execution authority

## SCOPE CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK

### **Scope Categories Protocol**
- **Component-Specific Scope**: Content affects single component only, no cross-component dependencies, isolated functionality/information, component-level placement appropriate, local integration pathways sufficient
- **Cross-Component Scope**: Content affects multiple related components, integration pathways required between components, bidirectional relationships needed, reference architecture placement required, cross-component quality gates needed
- **System-Wide Scope**: Content affects entire system architecture, authority/vision implications system-wide, standards/methodology implications, architecture-level placement required, system-level quality gates/validation needed
- **Ambiguous Scope**: Scope unclear during initial analysis, evolution potential affects scope determination, multiple valid scope interpretations possible, emergency protocol activation required, conservative system-wide placement approach needed

### **Scope Identification Indicators**
- **Component-Specific Indicators**: Content references single component/domain, functionality isolated to specific area, no system-wide implications, limited integration requirements, standard component placement patterns applicable
- **Cross-Component Indicators**: Content references multiple components/domains, integration pathways between components required, bidirectional relationships needed, reference architecture patterns applicable, cross-component coordination required
- **System-Wide Indicators**: Content affects system architecture/behavior, authority chain/vision implications, standards/methodology changes required, architecture-level placement needed, system-wide quality gates required
- **Ambiguous Scope Indicators**: Multiple scope interpretations possible, unclear system impact/implications, evolution potential affects scope assessment, insufficient information for definitive classification, expert consultation/additional analysis needed

### **Scope Classification Decision Matrix**
- **Impact Assessment Criteria**: Number of components affected (1, 2-5, 6+, system-wide), authority implications (none, component, cross-component, system), integration complexity (simple, moderate, complex, system-wide), evolution potential (stable, moderate, high, transformative)
- **Classification Decision Logic**: Single component + no authority + simple integration = Component-Specific | 2-5 components + moderate authority + moderate integration = Cross-Component | System impact + authority implications + complex integration = System-Wide | Unclear assessment + multiple interpretations = Ambiguous Scope
- **Classification Validation**: Decision confidence assessment (high, medium, low confidence), alternative scope considerations evaluated, risk assessment for scope misclassification, success criteria defined for scope classification
