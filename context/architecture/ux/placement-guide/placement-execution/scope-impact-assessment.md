**30/07/2025 19:30 CDMX** | Scope impact assessment and analysis protocols

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
placement-execution/README.md → scope-impact-assessment.md implements impact assessment per execution authority

## SCOPE IMPACT ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  

### **Current Impact Assessment**
- **System Components**: Primary/secondary components affected, functionality modifications, integration changes
- **Integration Requirements**: Pathways required, bidirectional references, cross-reference modifications, navigation updates
- **Functionality Changes**: Existing changes required, new additions, deprecation/removal, enhancement opportunities
- **Quality Gate Implications**: Gates affected, additional gates required, modifications needed, protocol updates

### **Future Impact Assessment**
- **Evolution Implications**: Content evolution potential/direction, system evolution impact, pathway facilitation/hindrance, compatibility
- **Scalability Considerations**: Content/placement/integration scalability with growth, performance assessment
- **Organic Growth**: Support through placement, direction compatibility, facilitation/constraint analysis, adaptation capability
- **Long-term Integration**: Pathway sustainability, complexity assessment, maintenance requirements, evolution capability

### **Authority Impact Assessment**
- **Chain Implications**: Modifications required, relationship changes, hierarchy impact, flow modifications
- **User Authority Preservation**: Preservation needs, enhancement opportunities, risk assessment, validation requirements
- **Conflict Potential**: Identify conflicts, prevention requirements, resolution preparation, harmony maintenance
- **Validation Needs**: Requirements for content, process modifications, quality gates, monitoring requirements

### **Integration Impact Assessment**
- **Cross-Reference Requirements**: System modifications, accuracy requirements, maintenance implications, scalability
- **Navigation Pathways**: Modifications required, user experience impact, efficiency implications, optimization opportunities
- **Reference Architecture**: Modifications required, pattern compliance, scalability implications, evolution compatibility
