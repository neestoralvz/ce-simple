## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
placement-execution/README.md → execution-quality-gates.md implements quality gates per execution authority

## EXECUTION QUALITY GATES FRAMEWORK

### **Pre-Implementation Quality Gates**
- **Authority Validation**: ✓ Authority validation completed, chain integrity verified, preservation requirements established, conflicts resolved
- **Scope Determination**: ✓ Scope verified/confirmed, impact assessment completed, classification accuracy verified, scope-placement alignment confirmed
- **Placement Location**: ✓ Location validated/approved, rationale documented, effectiveness predicted, risks identified/mitigated
- **Integration Pathway**: ✓ Pathway planned/validated, complexity assessed/managed, requirements documented, effectiveness predicted

### **During-Implementation Quality Gates**
- **Authority Chain Preservation**: ✓ Chain preservation maintained, integrity monitoring active, contamination prevention activated, validation checkpoints passed
- **File Size Compliance**: ✓ Size compliance monitored (≤80 lines), modularization triggers activated, violation prevention active, recovery protocols available
- **Reference Integrity**: ✓ Integrity maintained throughout, bidirectional consistency validated, accuracy verified continuously, system functionality preserved
- **Cross-Reference Consistency**: ✓ Consistency validated, updates applied systematically, chain integrity maintained, navigation functionality preserved

### **Post-Implementation Quality Gates**
- **Placement Effectiveness**: ✓ Effectiveness verified, objectives achieved/validated, user satisfaction confirmed, integration success verified
- **Integration Pathways**: ✓ Pathways functional, effectiveness validated, performance acceptable, maintenance feasible
- **Authority Chain Integrity**: ✓ Chain integrity confirmed, preservation effectiveness validated, contamination absence verified, validation system functional
- **Standards Compliance**: ✓ Compliance achieved, quality requirements satisfied, validation successful, adherence maintained

### **Ongoing Quality Gates**
- **Evolution Compatibility**: ✓ Compatibility maintained, organic growth accommodation verified, adaptation capability preserved, pathway sustainability confirmed
- **User Satisfaction**: ✓ User satisfaction confirmed, experience improvement validated, workflow enhancement verified, confidence improvement confirmed
- **System Efficiency**: ✓ Efficiency impact assessed, performance improvement confirmed, resource utilization optimized, maintenance efficiency enhanced
