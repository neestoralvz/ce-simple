## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
placement-execution/README.md → scope-placement-logic.md implements scope-based placement per execution authority

## SCOPE-BASED PLACEMENT LOGIC FRAMEWORK

### **Scope-Driven Placement Decisions**
- **Component Scope**: Single file modification/creation, component-specific directory, local integration pathways, component-level quality gates, functionality preservation
- **Cross-Component Scope**: Reference hub creation with modules, integration pathway establishment, bidirectional reference implementation, cross-component quality gates, integration effectiveness
- **System-Wide Scope**: Architecture-level placement (context/ root), system-wide integration pathways, complete authority chain validation, system-level quality gates, coherence/stability preservation
- **Ambiguous Scope**: Conservative system-wide approach, temporary placement with review planning, systematic scope clarification process, enhanced validation/monitoring, dynamic reassessment protocols

### **Scope-Integration Decision Framework**
- **Component Integration**: Simple local integration, component-specific reference pathways, functionality testing, component-level maintenance protocols
- **Cross-Component Integration**: Moderate cross-component integration, multi-component reference architecture, coordination testing, cross-component maintenance protocols
- **System-Wide Integration**: Complex system-wide integration, system architecture integration, coherence/stability testing, system-level maintenance protocols
- **Ambiguous Integration**: Conservative complex approach, flexible integration with reassessment capability, enhanced validation with uncertainty handling, dynamic maintenance with scope reassessment

### **Scope Placement Decision Validation**
- **Accuracy Validation**: Scope assessment accuracy verification, placement target appropriateness confirmation, integration approach effectiveness assessment, quality gate sufficiency validation
- **Effectiveness Validation**: User satisfaction assessment, integration effectiveness measurement, quality gate achievement verification, system impact accuracy confirmation
- **Efficiency Validation**: Decision time efficiency measurement, implementation efficiency assessment, maintenance efficiency evaluation, resource utilization optimization verification
- **Evolution Validation**: Adaptability assessment, evolution compatibility verification, organic growth accommodation confirmation, long-term sustainability evaluation
