## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
placement-validation/README.md → quality-assurance-validation.md implements quality assurance per validation authority

## QUALITY ASSURANCE VALIDATION FRAMEWORK

### **Standards Compliance Validation Protocol**
- **File Size Compliance (≤80 lines)**: Size measurement, violation detection, modularization assessment, compliance monitoring
- **Reference Format Standards**: Syntax validation, cross-reference consistency, bidirectional compliance, evolution compatibility
- **Authority Preservation Standards**: Chain format compliance, preservation validation, contamination prevention, system compliance
- **Integration Standards**: Pathway compliance, navigation format validation, cross-component integration, system adherence

### **Functionality Preservation Validation Protocol**
- **Original Functionality Preservation**: Identification, effectiveness validation, completeness verification, accuracy consistency
- **Enhanced Functionality Delivery**: Enhancement identification, effectiveness measurement, integration validation, user satisfaction
- **User Experience Improvement**: Enhancement identification, improvement measurement, satisfaction validation, workflow enhancement
- **System Efficiency Enhancement**: Improvement identification, performance measurement, resource optimization, scalability validation

### **Authority Preservation Validation Protocol**
- **User Voice Fidelity (≥95%)**: Preservation accuracy, authority fidelity validation, intent preservation, contamination prevention
- **Authority Chain Integrity**: Completeness verification, consistency validation, traceability maintenance, evolution compatibility
- **Supreme Authority Compliance**: Recognition enforcement, supremacy validation, preservation effectiveness, evolution accommodation
- **Authority Contamination Prevention**: Detection prevention, purity maintenance, drift prevention, restoration capability

### **Evolution Compatibility Validation Protocol**
- **Organic Growth Accommodation**: Capability validation, evolution support, pathway preservation, scalability assessment
- **Adaptation Flexibility Maintenance**: Capability verification, flexibility preservation, responsiveness assessment, effectiveness measurement
