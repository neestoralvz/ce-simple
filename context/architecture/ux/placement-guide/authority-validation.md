## AUTHORITY VALIDATION FRAMEWORK

### **Authority Source Identification**
```
Authority Source Validation:
├── User Authority Validation
│   ├── Direct user statements or instructions
│   ├── User vision or philosophy expressions
│   ├── User preference or requirement definitions
│   └── User authority supremacy enforcement requirements
├── System Authority Validation
│   ├── Technical implementation authority
│   ├── Process optimization authority
│   ├── Standards enforcement authority
│   └── System evolution authority
├── Shared Authority Validation
│   ├── User-system collaborative content
│   ├── Implementation guided by user vision
│   ├── System optimization within user boundaries
│   └── Reference architecture for shared content
└── Authority Conflict Resolution
    ├── Authority conflict identification
    ├── Authority supremacy determination
    ├── Conflict resolution protocol activation
    └── Authority chain reconstruction if needed
```

### **Authority Chain Validation**
```
Authority Chain Verification:
├── Supreme Authority Traceability
│   ├── VISION.md → User supreme authority verification
│   ├── TRUTH_SOURCE.md → Context architecture authority
│   ├── Specialized context → Domain authority validation
│   └── Implementation → Authority compliance verification
├── Authority Preservation Requirements
│   ├── User voice fidelity ≥95% requirement
│   ├── Authority chain integrity maintenance
│   ├── Authority contamination prevention
│   └── Clean slate capability for authority restoration
├── Authority Validation Checkpoints
│   ├── Pre-placement authority verification
│   ├── During-placement authority preservation
│   ├── Post-placement authority integrity validation
│   └── Ongoing authority chain monitoring
└── Authority Chain Repair
    ├── Broken authority chain identification
    ├── Authority source reconstruction
    ├── Authority relationship restoration
    └── Authority validation system integration
```

### **Authority-Based Placement Logic**
```
Authority-Driven Placement Decisions:
├── User Authority Content
│   ├── Placement: context/vision/ or context/authority.md
│   ├── Validation: Direct user vision alignment verification
│   ├── Preservation: Complete user voice preservation required
│   └── Integration: Supreme authority chain maintenance
├── System Authority Content
│   ├── Placement: context/methodology.md or specialized modules
│   ├── Validation: System authority boundary compliance
│   ├── Preservation: Technical accuracy and consistency
│   └── Integration: User authority supremacy preservation
├── Shared Authority Content
│   ├── Placement: Reference architecture with bidirectional links
│   ├── Validation: Both user and system authority compliance
│   ├── Preservation: Authority balance and boundary respect
│   └── Integration: Authority conflict prevention protocols
└── Authority Conflict Content
    ├── Placement: Temporary placement with resolution planning
    ├── Validation: Authority supremacy determination required
    ├── Preservation: User authority supremacy enforcement
    └── Integration: Authority chain repair and reconstruction
```

### **Authority Validation Protocol**
```
Authority Validation Process:
├── Authority Assessment
│   ├── Content authority source identification
│   ├── Authority level determination (Supreme/Primary/Secondary)
│   ├── Authority boundary analysis
│   └── Authority conflict detection
├── Authority Compliance Verification
│   ├── User authority supremacy compliance check
│   ├── Authority chain integrity verification
│   ├── Authority preservation requirement assessment
│   └── Authority contamination prevention validation
├── Authority-Based Decision Making
│   ├── Placement recommendation based on authority analysis
│   ├── Integration pathway determination
│   ├── Quality gate requirement specification
│   └── Authority preservation protocol activation
└── Authority Validation Documentation
    ├── Authority source documentation
    ├── Authority decision rationale recording
    ├── Authority preservation plan specification
    └── Authority validation checkpoint establishment
```
