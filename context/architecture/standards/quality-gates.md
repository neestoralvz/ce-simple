# Quality Gates - Validation Protocol Authority

**31/07/2025 13:50 CDMX** | Quality gates validation protocols extracted from standards.md

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA  
@context/architecture/standards.md → quality-gates.md implements quality gates authority per standards framework

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Systematic validation ensuring authority preservation"** - Quality gates prevent authority drift while maintaining system functionality and user voice fidelity.

## CORE QUALITY GATE FRAMEWORK

### **Quality Gates Protocol OBLIGATORIO**
- **Creation Phase**: → alignment verification → implementation validation → output verification
- **Alignment Verification**: User authority compliance confirmation OBLIGATORIO
- **Implementation Validation**: Technical execution accuracy and completeness verification
- **Output Verification**: Results validation against success criteria

### **Multi-Phase Validation System**
- **Pre-execution Validation**: Authority chain integrity + resource requirements verification
- **Mid-execution Monitoring**: Progress tracking + authority preservation monitoring
- **Post-execution Verification**: Complete functionality + user voice fidelity validation

### **Authority Preservation Requirements**
- **User Voice Fidelity**: 95%+ requirement maintained throughout all processes
- **Authority Chain Integrity**: Complete traceability to supreme authority sources
- **Anti-patterns Prevention**: Systematic detection and prevention of authority drift
- **Execution Flow Protection**: Quality gates never interrupt workflow momentum

## VALIDATION PROTOCOLS

### **Systematic Validation Checkpoints**
- **Authority Validation**: All decisions traced to user authority sources
- **Functionality Verification**: Complete operational integrity maintained
- **Quality Assurance**: Systematic verification of compliance standards
- **Performance Gates**: Efficiency and effectiveness metrics validation
