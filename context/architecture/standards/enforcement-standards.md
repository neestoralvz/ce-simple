# Enforcement Standards

**30/07/2025 Factorized** | Behavioral enforcement and quality gates authority

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
↑ @context/standards.md → Enforcement standards implementation per system standards authority

## BEHAVIORAL ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOLS

### Anti-Patterns Prevention
**Execution Flow Protection**: Prevent workflow interruption through anticipatory pattern detection
**Quality Gate Enforcement**: Pre/mid/post-execution checkpoints with binary compliance validation
**Behavioral Programming**: Systematic behavioral modification through reinforcement vocabulary
**Authority Preservation**: User voice fidelity (95%+ requirement) through systematic preservation protocols

### Orchestration Protocol Integration
**Task Tool Validation**: Mandatory standards compliance in all subagent delegation
**Command Execution Standards**: Standards compliance required before completion
**System Evolution Standards**: Standards adaptation preserving user authority supremacy
**Continuous Execution**: Standards enforcement never interrupts workflow momentum

## QUALITY GATES VALIDATION

### Creation → Alignment → Verification Protocol
**OBLIGATORIO Quality Gates**: Systematic validation at each stage of implementation
**Binary Assessment**: COMPLIANT/NON-COMPLIANT determination with zero tolerance for violations
**Authority Chain Validation**: Complete traceability to supreme authority sources at each gate
**User Voice Fidelity**: 95%+ preservation requirement across all enforcement actions

### Systematic Validation Framework
**Pre-execution Validation**: Authority alignment and vision compliance verification
**Mid-execution Monitoring**: Real-time standards compliance and quality gate adherence
**Post-execution Assessment**: Complete functionality and authority preservation validation
**Recovery Protocols**: Systematic correction procedures for standards violations

**ENFORCEMENT STANDARDS AUTHORITY**: Behavioral enforcement and quality gates serving system standards through systematic validation and authority preservation protocols.
