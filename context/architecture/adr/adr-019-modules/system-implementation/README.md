## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/architecture/adr/ADR-019-handoffs-system-implementation.md → system-implementation/ implements remediation architecture per ADR-019 authority

## 4-PHASE CRITICAL REMEDIATION ARCHITECTURE

### **Phase-Based Systematic Remediation**
```
Phase 1: CRITICAL UX SYSTEM REMEDIATION (5 days)
├── Target: 4 UX flowchart files (1,881 lines → ≤320 lines)
├── Protocol: L2-MODULAR extraction with authority preservation
└── Priority: CRITICAL (580% file size violations)

Phase 2: TEMPLATE SYSTEM COMPLIANCE (4 weeks)  
├── Target: 5 template files (1,762 lines → ≤400 lines)
├── Protocol: Modular reference architecture
└── Priority: HIGH (template system compliance exemplar)

Phase 3: CORE SYSTEM FACTORIZATION (3 weeks)
├── Target: 6 core system files (1,905 lines → ≤480 lines)
├── Protocol: Authority-preserving decomposition  
└── Priority: HIGH (system integration integrity)

Phase 4: GUARDIAN SYSTEM DEPLOYMENT (4 weeks)
├── Target: Automated compliance monitoring system
├── Protocol: Binary enforcement + Partner Constructor integration
└── Priority: MEDIUM (prevention architecture)
```

## STRATEGIC REQUIREMENTS

### **Critical System Remediation Needs**
**Critical System Remediation**: Multiple file size violations requiring systematic remediation across 4 phases
**Multi-Conversation Coordination**: Complex tasks requiring parallel execution with dependency management  
**Authority Preservation**: Complete user voice fidelity maintenance through multi-session workflows

## STRATEGIC EXECUTION BENEFITS

### **Multi-Session Excellence Benefits**
