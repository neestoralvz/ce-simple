# ADR-007: Progressive Context Loading Intelligence

**Date**: 30/07/2025 17:45 CDMX  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Authority**: User conversation-first vision + system efficiency optimization

## Context

System needs intelligent context loading that adapts to conversation complexity without overwhelming cognitive load. Current monolithic context loading creates inefficiency and breaks natural conversation flow.

User vision: "conversation natural que de esa conversación natural salga el resultado" requires progressive disclosure that preserves conversation continuity while ensuring appropriate context depth.

## Decision

**APPROVED**: README-driven progressive context loading with semantic trigger intelligence

### Implementation Framework:
1. **Conversation Complexity Assessment** → Dynamic context loading depth
2. **Semantic Trigger Recognition** → Automatic README chain activation  
3. **Progressive Disclosure Protocol** → Primary → Secondary → Authority → Integration
4. **Context Loading Intelligence** → Conversation-driven README routing per @README_NAVIGATION_INTEGRATION.md

### Context Loading Logic:
```
IF conversation_complexity = simple: PRIMARY README only
IF conversation_complexity = moderate: PRIMARY + SECONDARY README  
IF conversation_complexity = complex: PRIMARY + SECONDARY + AUTHORITY README
IF conversation_complexity = system-wide: Complete README chain + @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md
```

### Authority Preservation:
- Supreme authority validation through README chains maintained
- User vision supremacy preserved in all context loading decisions
- Progressive disclosure serves conversation-first development principles

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **Conversation Flow Preservation**: Context loads without interrupting natural dialogue
- **Cognitive Load Optimization**: Appropriate context depth without overwhelming information
- **System Efficiency**: Token economy optimization through intelligent loading
- **Organic Discovery**: Context reveals based on actual conversation needs

### Metrics & Validation:
- **Context Efficiency**: Measure loading time vs conversation effectiveness
- **User Satisfaction**: Natural conversation flow preservation metrics
- **System Performance**: Token usage optimization through progressive loading
- **Authority Preservation**: 95%+ user voice fidelity through README chains

### Evolution Benefits:
- README navigation becomes more intelligent through usage pattern learning
- Context loading adapts organically to system growth and user preferences
- Semantic trigger recognition improves with conversation effectiveness data

## Implementation Evidence

### Integration Points:
- ✅ **Semantic Triggers**: @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md dispatcher integration
- ✅ **README Navigation**: @README_NAVIGATION_INTEGRATION.md protocol compliance
- ✅ **Progressive Disclosure**: Conversation complexity → context depth mapping
- ✅ **Authority Chain**: Supreme authority validation through README routing

### Success Criteria:
- Context loading responds to conversation complexity automatically
- README chains activate based on semantic pattern recognition
- Natural conversation flow preserved through progressive disclosure
- System efficiency improves while maintaining complete functionality
