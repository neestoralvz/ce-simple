# ADR-004: Think x4 Methodology Universal Integration

**Date**: 2025-07-30  
**Status**: ACCEPTED  
**Authority**: User methodology supremacy → context/TRUTH_SOURCE.md → ADR-004

## Context

Think x4 systematic analysis methodology lacks universal integration across system components. Current implementation fragmented across CLAUDE.md references without systematic enforcement. Decision-making quality inconsistent due to missing standardized four-perspective analysis framework.

**Problem Statement**: 
- Analytical decisions made without systematic perspective validation
- "Instinto" and "intuition" usage violates methodology authority  
- Missing traceability in complex decision processes
- Authority preservation compromised by inconsistent analysis standards

## Decision

**UNIVERSAL THINK x4 INTEGRATION OBLIGATORY** across all system components with enforcement vocabulary integration.

### Implementation Framework:
1. **Systematic Analysis OBLIGATORY**: Four perspectives SIEMPRE required before conclusions
2. **Enforcement Vocabulary**: "Think x4 OBLIGATORIO" replaces assumption-based decisions  
3. **Authority Preservation**: Each perspective validates against supreme authority chain
4. **Traceability Protocol**: Decision rationale documented through four-perspective analysis

### Four Perspectives Standard:
- **Perspective 1**: User vision alignment validation
- **Perspective 2**: System coherence and simplicity assessment  
- **Perspective 3**: Implementation effectiveness and resource impact
- **Perspective 4**: Evolution compatibility and organic growth support

### Integration Points:
- **CLAUDE.md**: Semantic triggers OBLIGATORIO activate Think x4 protocols
- **methodology.md**: Think x4 SIEMPRE integration in all systematic processes
- **patterns.md**: Pattern validation DEBE include four-perspective analysis
- **standards.md**: Quality gates OBLIGATORIO implement Think x4 validation

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **Systematic Decision Quality**: Four-perspective analysis eliminates assumption-based conclusions
- **Authority Preservation**: Each perspective validates against user vision supremacy
- **Decision Traceability**: Complete rationale documentation through perspective analysis
- **Consistency Standards**: Universal methodology application across all components

### Negative:
- **Analysis Overhead**: Additional time investment for systematic perspective validation
- **Learning Curve**: Team adaptation to mandatory four-perspective requirement

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Efficiency Templates**: Standardized Think x4 templates reduce analysis time
- **Training Integration**: Systematic methodology education in all workflows

## Compliance Monitoring

**Enforcement Protocol**: Guardian role OBLIGATORIO validates Think x4 compliance
**Quality Gates**: Pre-decision validation DEBE include four-perspective completion
**Standards Integration**: Think x4 compliance FUNDAMENTAL for all architectural decisions
