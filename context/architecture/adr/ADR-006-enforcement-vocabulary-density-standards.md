# ADR-006: Enforcement Vocabulary Density Standards

**Date**: 30/07/2025 23:45 CDMX  
**Status**: ACCEPTED  
**Authority**: @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → enforcement vocabulary standards

## Context
ADR-002 implemented 32 enforcement vocabulary terms achieving compliance visibility. Analysis reveals cognitive load management needs optimization while maintaining user standards authority: "OBLIGATORIO usar DEBE, SIEMPRE, NUNCA, OBLIGATORIO, FUNDAMENTAL, ESENCIAL."

## Decision
**ENFORCEMENT VOCABULARY DENSITY FRAMEWORK** with cognitive load optimization.

### Think x4 Analysis OBLIGATORIO
**Perspective 1**: 32 enforcement terms provide clear compliance signals with binary enforcement eliminating ambiguity  
**Perspective 2**: Cognitive load types - intrinsic (unavoidable), germane (beneficial schema), extraneous (minimize)  
**Perspective 3**: Standards integration through consolidated reference architecture preserving authority chain  
**Perspective 4**: Vocabulary evolution based on compliance effectiveness metrics and user feedback

### Enforcement Vocabulary Framework

#### **Tier 1: Critical Enforcement (Binary Mode)**
- **OBLIGATORIO**: Non-negotiable system requirements
- **NUNCA**: Absolute prohibitions preventing system failure
- **CRÍTICO**: Authority chain preservation requirements

#### **Tier 2: Strong Guidance (Systematic Mode)**
- **DEBE**: Expected behavior with measurable compliance
- **SIEMPRE**: Consistent application requirements
- **MANDATORIO**: Process integrity requirements

#### **Tier 3: Professional Standards (Quality Mode)**
- **ESENCIAL**: Core functionality preservation
- **FUNDAMENTAL**: Architecture principle compliance
- **SISTEMÁTICO**: Methodology consistency requirements

### Cognitive Load Optimization Protocol

→ **Detailed Guidelines**: @context/architecture/adr/modules/cognitive-load-optimization.md

**Density Limits**: Maximum 5 enforcement terms per ≤80 lines
**Distribution Strategy**: Front-loaded critical terms, context-aware density
**Measurement Protocol**: Enforcement density ratio ≤ 5%, Authority preservation ≥ 95%

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Optimized cognitive efficiency**: Reduced extraneous load preserving compliance
- **Systematic enforcement clarity**: Tiered vocabulary provides graduated response
- **Authority preservation**: 95%+ user voice fidelity maintained
- **Standards compliance**: Clear enforcement without cognitive overwhelm

### Quality Enhancement
- **Measurable compliance**: Density metrics provide optimization feedback
- **Evolutionary vocabulary**: Organic refinement based on effectiveness data
- **Professional standards**: Research-backed cognitive load management
