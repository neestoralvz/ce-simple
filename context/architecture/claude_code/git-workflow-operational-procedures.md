# Git Workflow Operational Procedures - Daily Operations Hub

**31/07/2025 09:20 CDMX** | Git workflow operational procedures with systematic daily operations

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/architecture/claude-code.md → git-workflow-operational-procedures.md implements daily Git operations per Claude Code integration authority

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Systematic procedures ensure consistent Git workflow execution while maintaining conversation-first development"** - All Git operations follow established procedures with monitoring and validation.

## OPERATIONAL MODULES

### **Daily Operations Domain**
- **Daily Procedures**: → @context/architecture/claude_code/git-workflow/daily-operational-procedures.md
- **Morning Health Check**: System health validation + Git repository status + Hook verification
- **Conversation Management**: Standard initiation + commit procedures + completion workflows
- **Integration Protocols**: Branch management + merge procedures + push coordination

### **System Reliability Domain**
- **Troubleshooting**: → @context/architecture/claude_code/git-workflow/troubleshooting-procedures.md
- **Hook Recovery**: Git hook failure diagnosis and recovery protocols
- **Performance Diagnosis**: System performance analysis and optimization procedures

### **Maintenance Domain**
- **Monitoring & Maintenance**: → @context/architecture/claude_code/git-workflow/monitoring-maintenance-procedures.md
- **Weekly Maintenance**: Repository cleanup + health reporting + performance baseline updates
- **Emergency Recovery**: Emergency backup + integrity checks + recovery procedures

## INFRASTRUCTURE AUTHORITY
**Operational Excellence**: Systematic procedures ensure consistent Git workflow execution
**Monitoring Integration**: All procedures integrate with monitoring infrastructure (event-capture.py, system-health.py)
**Conversation-First Support**: Procedures designed to support conversation-first development workflow
**Recovery Capabilities**: Complete troubleshooting and emergency recovery protocols included

## PROCEDURAL INTEGRITY
**Bash Executable**: All procedures are bash-executable scripts with validation and error handling
**Tool Integration**: Systematic integration with automation tools (think-x4-validator.sh, monitoring tools)
**Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance tracking and optimization recommendations
**Quality Assurance**: Validation checkpoints throughout all operational procedures
