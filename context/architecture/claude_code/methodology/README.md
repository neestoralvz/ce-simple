## Purpose
Methodology adaptations that leverage Claude Code's concurrent tools, WebSearch integration, and multi-conversation capabilities.

## Content Focus
- **Parallel Tool Execution**: WebSearch + MCP context7 simultaneous patterns
- **Multi-Conversation Orchestration**: Git worktree-based parallel execution
- **Research-First Optimization**: Claude Code research tool integration
- **Continuous Execution**: CLI-optimized workflow maintenance
- **Script-Automation Framework**: â†’ script-automation-framework.md (systematic batch processing with safety controls)

## Integration
Specialized implementations of core methodologies adapted for Claude Code's tool ecosystem.

## Evolution Pathway
Methodologies refine based on Claude Code performance metrics and user workflow optimization discoveries.
