# Workflow Architecture

**30/07/2025 15:45 CDMX** | Process architecture and orchestration patterns

## PURPOSE
Define workflow patterns and process architectures that enable organic system evolution while preserving user authority through intelligent orchestration.

## CONTENT CRITERIA
**Belongs here:**
- Process flow architecture and orchestration patterns
- Multi-conversation coordination and parallel execution patterns
- Integration workflow patterns between system components
- Background process architecture and persistent state patterns
- Workflow evolution and adaptive process patterns

**Exclusions:**
- Specific command implementations
- Content organization patterns
- User interface workflow details

## NAMING CONVENTIONS
Format: `[workflow-type]-[process-focus].md`
Examples:
- `orchestration-multi-conversation.md`
- `integration-cross-system.md`
- `background-persistent-process.md`
- `evolution-adaptive-workflow.md`

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE STRUCTURE
```markdown
# [Workflow Type] Architecture

## Process Purpose
What this workflow achieves

## Flow Components
Key process elements and connections

## Orchestration Pattern
