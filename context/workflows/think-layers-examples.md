# Think Layers - Detailed Implementation Examples and JSON Schemas

## 🤖 Plan Consolidation Framework Examples

### Documentation Task Detection Patterns
**AUTOMATIC Classification Patterns**:
- README creation/updates
- API documentation generation  
- Code documentation and comments
- Guide and tutorial creation
- Architecture documentation
- Changelog and release notes
- Any .md file creation/modification
- Documentation standards compliance
- Cross-reference integration

### Agent Delegation Notifications
**DOCS-AGENT Deployment** (When documentation tasks detected):
```
📊 CONSOLIDATION: Auto-detecting [X] documentation + [Y] execution tasks
🤖 DOCS-AGENT: Deploying independent agent → /docs-workflow execution
📋 TODO-PLANS: Structured task package → Complete context transfer
⚡ PARALLEL: Main workflow continues → Implementation roadmap execution
```

### Todo Plans JSON Schema
**Todo Plans Format** (for `/docs-workflow` integration):
```json
{
  "session_id": "analysis-[timestamp]",
  "source": "think-layers-consolidation", 
  "context": {
    "analysis_summary": "[synthesis executive summary]",
    "project_scope": "[analysis target and boundaries]",
    "quality_requirements": "CLAUDE.md standards + cross-reference integration"
  },
  "todo_plans": [
    {
      "category": "documentation",
      "task": "[specific documentation task]",
      "priority": "high|medium|low",
      "context": "[task-specific context]",
      "acceptance_criteria": "[completion requirements]"
    }
  ],
  "execution_context": {
    "original_request": "[user original request]",
    "analysis_depth": "[layer-reached]",
    "key_findings": "[critical insights]"
  }
}
```

## 💡 Problem Resolution Integration Examples

### Complex Problem Scenarios
**ENHANCED Integration** with `/problem-solving` for identified issues:

#### Technical Challenge Detection
```
🔍 ISSUE: Technical implementation challenge identified
📊 ANALYSIS: Layer-3 synthesis reveals [complexity indicators]
🤖 TRIGGER: Auto-activating /problem-solving workflow
🧠 CONTEXT: Analysis findings → Problem-solving context transfer
```

#### Performance Optimization Discovery
```
⚡ PERFORMANCE: Optimization opportunities identified
📈 METRICS: Layer-2 analysis reveals [performance gaps]
🔧 SOLUTION: Enhanced problem-solving with performance focus
📋 INTEGRATION: Think-layers findings → Optimization strategy
```

### Problem-Solving Integration Flow
**Workflow Handoff Pattern**:
1. **DETECTION**: Think-layers identify complex implementation challenges
2. **CLASSIFICATION**: Automatic problem categorization and severity assessment
3. **CONTEXT TRANSFER**: Complete analysis findings → Problem-solving workflow
4. **PARALLEL PROCESSING**: Continue think-layers while problem-solving executes
5. **SOLUTION INTEGRATION**: Problem-solving results → Think-layers synthesis

## 📊 Advanced Analysis Patterns

### Layer-Specific Analysis Templates

#### Layer-1 (THINK) - Foundation Analysis
```
🧠 FOUNDATION: Core concept identification and initial understanding
📋 SCOPE: Problem boundaries and requirement clarification
🔍 RESEARCH: Essential information gathering and context building

```

#### Layer-2 (THINK-HARD) - Deep Analysis
```
💪 DEEP-DIVE: Comprehensive pattern analysis and system understanding
🔬 INVESTIGATION: Root cause analysis and dependency mapping
📊 EVALUATION: Multiple approach assessment and trade-off analysis
🧩 SYNTHESIS: Component integration and relationship modeling
```

#### Layer-3 (THINK-HARDER) - Complex Integration
```
🚀 INTEGRATION: Multi-system coordination and architectural planning
⚡ OPTIMIZATION: Performance and efficiency considerations
🛡️ RISK-ASSESSMENT: Security, scalability, and maintenance analysis
📈 STRATEGY: Long-term implications and evolution planning
```

#### Layer-4 (ULTRA-THINK) - Ultra Synthesis
```
⭐ MASTERY: Comprehensive solution architecture and implementation roadmap
🌐 ECOSYSTEM: Broad impact analysis and stakeholder considerations
🔮 FUTURE-PROOFING: Adaptability and evolution pathway design
📋 EXECUTION: Detailed implementation plan with success metrics
```

## 🎯 Quality Assurance Examples

### Analysis Validation Criteria
**QUALITY Gates** per layer:

**Layer-1**: Foundation completeness, scope clarity, direction validation
**Layer-2**: Pattern recognition accuracy, dependency completeness, approach viability
**Layer-3**: Integration coherence, risk assessment thoroughness, optimization validity
**Layer-4**: Solution completeness, implementation feasibility, success metrics definition

### Progression Decision Examples
```
🧠 PROGRESSION: Layer-1 complete → Advancing to Layer-2
📊 ASSESSMENT: [X] foundation elements validated → Deep analysis initiated
🔍 CRITERIA: Scope clarity [✓], direction identified [✓], research complete [✓]
⚡ ADVANCEMENT: Layer-2 activation → Deep pattern analysis beginning
```
