# Quality Gates Validation Protocols - Quality Assurance Authority

**30/07/2025 CDMX** | Quality gates validation with systematic checkpoint protocols

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
← enforcement_compliance_metrics.md → quality gates validation protocols serve systematic quality assurance per validation authority

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Quality gates validation preserving user authority supremacy"** - All quality gates validate systematic execution while maintaining 95%+ user voice fidelity.

## PRE-EXECUTION QUALITY GATES

### Creation Phase Validation
```
Pre-Execution Checklist:
├─ Authority Source Validated: □ VISION.md or @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md confirmation
├─ Think x4 Framework Applied: □ 4 perspectives documented
├─ Reference Architecture Planned: □ Bidirectional reference design
└─ Standards Compliance Verified: □ Enforcement vocabulary precision
```

## MID-EXECUTION QUALITY GATES

### Alignment Phase Validation
```
Mid-Execution Monitoring:
├─ Authority Chain Preservation: [X]% maintained throughout process
├─ User Voice Fidelity: [X]% preserved during implementation (95%+ requirement)
├─ Reference Integrity: [X]% bidirectional consistency maintained
└─ Standards Compliance: [X]% enforcement requirements met
```

## POST-EXECUTION QUALITY GATES

### Verification Phase Validation
```
Post-Execution Verification:
├─ Functionality Completeness: [X]% objectives achieved
├─ Authority Preservation: [X]% user voice fidelity maintained (95%+ requirement)
├─ System Integration: [X]% seamless integration with existing components
└─ Evolution Readiness: [X]% organic growth compatibility confirmed
```

## QUALITY ASSURANCE METHODOLOGY

### Validation Framework
- **Systematic Checkpoints**: Quality gates at pre/mid/post-execution phases
- **Authority Preservation**: 95%+ user voice fidelity maintained throughout
- **Reference Integrity**: 100% bidirectional consistency validation
- **Standards Compliance**: Enforcement vocabulary precision verification

### Quality Gate Escalation
- **Green**: All quality gates passed, proceed with execution
- **Yellow**: Minor issues identified, require resolution before continuation
- **Red**: Critical quality gate failures, stop execution immediately
