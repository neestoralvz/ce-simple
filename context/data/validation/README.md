# Validation Data - Quality Assurance Metrics

**30/07/2025 11:30 CDMX** | Quality, compliance, and authority preservation metrics

## Purpose
Quantitative validation of system quality, user authority preservation, and standards compliance across all system components.

## Content Focus
- **Authority Preservation**: Metrics like "95%+ user voice preservation" tracking vision fidelity
- **Standards Compliance**: Measurements such as "94.4% compliance" across system standards
- **Vision Alignment**: Quantitative validation of system evolution against user vision
- **Quality Gates**: Pass/fail metrics for creation→alignment→verification protocols

## Integration References

### ← patterns/
**Connection**: Pattern effectiveness measurement and empirical validation support
**Protocol**: Validation metrics provide empirical evidence for pattern success and quality assurance

### ↑ @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md
**Authority Source**: Supreme authority validation drives all quality measurement criteria
**Protocol**: All validation metrics serve user vision preservation and authority compliance

**Connection**: Comprehensive data component integration for system quality assurance
**Protocol**: Validation data ensures system evolution maintains user authority supremacy and quality standards

## Evolution Pathway
Validation metrics expand as system complexity grows, maintaining quality assurance as system scales through empirical measurement and authority-aligned validation.
