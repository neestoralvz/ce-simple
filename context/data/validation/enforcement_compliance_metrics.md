# Enforcement Compliance Metrics - Systematic Quality Measurement Authority

**30/07/2025 16:45 CDMX** | Comprehensive enforcement measurement navigation hub

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → context/data/validation/ → enforcement_compliance_metrics.md implements systematic compliance measurement per quality assurance authority

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Measurable compliance validation preserving user authority supremacy"** - All enforcement metrics serve empirical validation of system effectiveness while maintaining 95%+ user voice fidelity requirement.

## COMPLIANCE MEASUREMENT DOMAIN NAVIGATION

### **ADR Compliance Measurement Domain**
**Complete ADR Implementation Protocols**: → compliance-metrics/adr-compliance-protocols.md
