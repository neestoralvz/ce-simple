# Data Component - Quantitative System Intelligence

**30/07/2025 11:30 CDMX** | Metrics, evidence, and system performance data

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
↑ @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → data/ provides empirical evidence while preserving user authority supremacy

## PURPOSE
Quantitative foundation for evidence-based system evolution serving user vision and organic growth principles.

## CONTENT ORGANIZATION

### `/conversations/` - Dialogue Analysis
Session metrics, vision discovery rates, socratic effectiveness, user satisfaction data

### `/performance/` - System Optimization 
Token economy, execution time, resource utilization: "28% efficiency gain with preserved functionality"

### `/usage/` - Growth Patterns
Command frequency, organic evolution triggers, user preference patterns

### `/validation/` - Quality Assurance
Authority preservation: "95%+ user voice fidelity", standards compliance: "94.4% compliance scores"

## DATA PRINCIPLES
- **Non-Intrusive**: Never disrupts conversation flow
- **User-Controlled**: User authority over collection and analysis
- **Purpose-Driven**: Only data serving system improvement
- **Authority-Preserving**: Data supports but never overrides user judgment

## EVOLUTION PROTOCOL
**Evidence Collection** → **User Validation** → **Authority-Aligned Action**

### Measurement Categories
**Efficiency**: Token optimization, execution performance
**Quality**: Vision preservation, authority compliance
**Growth**: Organic evolution indicators, necessity validation
**Compliance**: Standards adherence, anti-pattern prevention

### Placement Logic
**Conversation effectiveness** → conversations/
**System performance** → performance/
**Usage patterns** → usage/
**Quality/compliance** → validation/
