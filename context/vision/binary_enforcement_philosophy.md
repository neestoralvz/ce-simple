## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/vision/vision_foundation.md ‚Üí supreme user authority ‚Üí binary_enforcement_philosophy.md implements binary validation vision

## CORE BINARY PHILOSOPHY

### Binary Enforcement Vision
**"Binary enforcement (COMPLIANT/VIOLATION) with immediate correction requirements"**
- No intermediate states in compliance assessment
- Clear, unambiguous validation results
- Immediate action required for violations
- Binary clarity eliminates interpretation ambiguity

### Guardian Binary Authority
**"COMPLIANT or VIOLATION assessment only"**
- Guardian reports only binary states
- No negotiation or intermediate compliance levels
- Clear authority enforcement without exceptions
- Binary validation preserves vision integrity

## BINARY ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

### COMPLIANT State Definition
**Vision compliance achieved**: All authority chain requirements met + User vision supremacy preserved + Standards compliance validated + System integrity maintained

### VIOLATION State Definition
**Vision compliance compromised**: Authority chain breached + User vision contradicted + Standards non-compliance detected + System integrity at risk

### No Intermediate States
**Binary philosophy authority**: No "partially compliant" assessments + No "working toward compliance" states + No "mostly compliant with exceptions" + No negotiation of compliance levels

## IMMEDIATE CORRECTION PROTOCOL

### Violation Response Authority
**"Immediate correction requirements"**: Violations require immediate attention + No deferral of compliance correction + No acceptance of temporary non-compliance + No gradual compliance improvement plans

### Correction Validation Process
1. **VIOLATION identified** ‚Üí Binary assessment confirmed
2. **Immediate correction required** ‚Üí No delay acceptable
3. **Correction implemented** ‚Üí Authority validation mandatory
4. **COMPLIANT status achieved** ‚Üí Binary validation confirmed

## BINARY ENFORCEMENT FRAMEWORK

‚Üí **Complete Binary Implementation**: @context/vision/modules/binary-enforcement-framework.md

### System Integration
**Guardian binary function**: Vision enforcer with binary compliance validation  
**Standards binary validation**: Implementation alignment through binary compliance  
**Quality gates**: Pre/mid/post-execution binary checkpoints  
**Authority source**: Direct @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md compliance

### Anti-Compromise Philosophy
**"No mercy" enforcement through binary clarity**: No compromise on vision principles + No "good enough" compliance acceptance + No gradual standards erosion tolerance + Clear compliance states prevent contamination

### Binary Communication Standards
- ‚úÖ COMPLIANT - Full compliance achieved
- ‚ùå VIOLATION - Immediate correction required
- üõ°Ô∏è Guardian enforcement activated
- üîÑ Correction validation pending
