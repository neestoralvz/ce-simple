# H-CORE-DISPATCHER: Core Command Dispatcher Design - L2-MODULAR Hub

**31/07/2025 CDMX** | Lightweight dispatcher architecture with intelligent routing

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/architecture/patterns/l2-modular-extraction-patterns.md → H-CORE-DISPATCHER implements lightweight dispatcher design per routing optimization methodology

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Lightweight dispatcher with intelligent routing and graceful degradation"** - Core command factorization creating intelligent dispatcher (≤30 lines) with 6 specialized subcommands and fallback mechanisms.

## DISPATCHER ARCHITECTURE

### Core Dispatcher Design
- **Primary Function**: Intelligent routing to specialized subcommands
- **Target Size**: ≤30 lines for optimal performance
- **Routing Logic**: Semantic pattern recognition and delegation
- **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation with manual alternatives

### Subcommand Architecture
```
DISPATCHER ROUTING:
├── /core-workspace: Workspace management and setup
├── /core-decision: Decision matrix and routing intelligence
├── /core-orchestrate: L4-Pure orchestration and coordination
├── /core-scope: GitHub scope management and issue handling
├── /core-validate: Validation and quality gates
└── /core-finalize: Conversation finalization and extraction
```

## DESIGN BENEFITS

### Performance Advantages
- **Token efficiency**: 60-80% reduction in context loading
- **Execution speed**: Faster routing and specialized processing
- **Modular maintenance**: Individual subcommand updates
- **Graceful degradation**: Fallback mechanisms prevent workflow blocking
