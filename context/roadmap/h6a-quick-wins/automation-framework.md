# Automation Framework - Script-Driven Processing System

**Module**: h6a-quick-wins/automation-framework.md  
**Parent**: H6A-QUICK-WINS.md  
**Purpose**: Script-driven automation framework for systematic violation processing

## SCRIPT-DRIVEN AUTOMATION FRAMEWORK

### Primary Script: enhanced_analyze_violations.sh
```bash
AUTOMATION CAPABILITIES:
├── Real-time violation detection and categorization
├── Automated whitespace optimization and line consolidation
├── Header format standardization and redundancy elimination
├── Authority preservation validation throughout processing
└── Batch processing with rollback capability on errors
```

### Secondary Scripts Integration
- **`validation_suite.sh`**: Continuous authority fidelity monitoring (95%+ requirement)
- **`batch_reference_updater.sh`**: Automated cross-reference integrity maintenance
- **`rollback_cascade.sh`**: Instant rollback for failed optimizations

## AUTOMATION BENEFITS

### Processing Efficiency
- **70% effort reduction** compared to manual processing
- **Batch processing capability** for systematic violation resolution
- **Real-time validation** ensuring authority preservation throughout
- **Automated rollback** for error prevention and recovery
