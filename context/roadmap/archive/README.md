# Handoffs Archive - Completed Task Documentation

**31/07/2025 CDMX** | Archive of successfully completed handoff operations

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
context/handoffs/ → archive/ implements completed handoff preservation per system organization authority

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Successful handoff preservation enables learning and methodology validation"** - All completed handoffs archived with complete documentation for knowledge transfer and process improvement.
