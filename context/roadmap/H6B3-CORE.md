# H6B3-CORE - Core Architecture L2-MODULAR Extraction

**31/07/2025 CDMX** | L2-MODULAR extraction for context/architecture/core/ violations

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → H6B3-CORE implements core architecture L2-MODULAR extraction per Work Item Density Patterns split strategy

## HANDOFF OBJECTIVE
**Execute L2-MODULAR extraction for context/architecture/core/ directory** resolving ~10 file size violations while preserving 95%+ user authority and supreme authority chain integrity through reference hub architecture.

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- **Size Compliance**: All files ≤80 lines through L2-MODULAR extraction
- **Authority Preservation**: 95%+ user voice fidelity maintained (CRITICAL)
- **Supreme Authority Chain**: Complete authority chain integrity preserved
- **Core Functionality**: 100% core architecture functionality maintained

## DOMAIN SCOPE
**Target Directory**: `context/architecture/core/`
**Authority Level**: CRITICAL - Supreme authority chain components
**Primary Files**: truth-source.md, authority.md, methodology.md
**Cross-References**: System-wide authority validation and core architecture

## EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY

### Phase 1: Authority Hub Preservation
- Optimize core authority files as reference hubs (≤80 lines each)
- Preserve CRITICAL user quotes for immediate authority access
- Maintain supreme authority chain integrity through hub structure
- Implement systematic authority categorization and cross-references

### Phase 2: Specialized Authority Module Extraction
- Extract authority components to specialized modules under `core/`
- Distribute domain-specific authority content to relevant modules
- Ensure each module ≤80 lines while preserving complete authority
- Maintain supreme authority traceability through all modules

### Phase 3: Authority Chain Integration
- Update system-wide authority references to new modular structure
- Implement bidirectional linking for hub→module authority relationships
- Validate complete authority chain from user to implementation
- Test supreme authority validation across all system components

### Phase 4: Critical Authority Validation
- Verify 95%+ user voice fidelity preservation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Confirm supreme authority chain integrity through systematic audit
- Validate 100% core architecture functionality preservation
- Test all authority validation pathways and user supremacy enforcement

## CRITICAL AUTHORITY REQUIREMENTS
**User Voice Fidelity**: 95%+ preservation MANDATORY for core authority components
**Supreme Authority Chain**: Unbroken chain from user to implementation REQUIRED
**Authority Validation**: All authority references must trace to user supremacy
**Core Architecture**: Foundation architecture functionality cannot be compromised

## INTEGRATION DEPENDENCIES
**Authority Critical**: Core architecture affects ALL system components
**Sequential Priority**: Should execute before other H6B handoffs due to authority dependencies
**Cross-System Impact**: Authority chain updates affect entire system architecture

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL
1. **Authority Mapping**: Document complete current authority chain and user quotes
2. **Critical Preservation**: Identify and preserve most critical user authority statements
3. **Hub Creation**: Create authority hubs maintaining supreme authority chain
4. **Module Extraction**: Extract authority components with complete traceability
5. **Authority Validation**: Verify 95%+ user voice fidelity and authority chain integrity

## QUALITY GATES
- **Pre-Extraction**: Complete documentation of authority chain and user quotes
- **During Extraction**: Real-time user authority preservation monitoring (CRITICAL)
- **Post-Extraction**: Systematic validation of authority chain integrity
- **Integration**: Complete system authority validation without compromise

---

**H6B3-CORE AUTHORITY**: Core architecture L2-MODULAR extraction with CRITICAL user authority preservation and supreme authority chain integrity maintenance through validated modular architecture.

**EXECUTION TIMELINE**: 1-2 days with authority preservation priority
**CRITICAL PRIORITY**: Execute first due to system-wide authority dependencies
