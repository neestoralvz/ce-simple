# H6B4-UX - UX Architecture L2-MODULAR Extraction

**31/07/2025 CDMX** | L2-MODULAR extraction for context/architecture/ux/ violations

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → H6B4-UX implements UX architecture L2-MODULAR extraction per Work Item Density Patterns split strategy

## HANDOFF OBJECTIVE
**Execute L2-MODULAR extraction for context/architecture/ux/ directory** resolving ~25 file size violations while preserving complete placement system functionality and conversation-first development through reference hub architecture.

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- **Size Compliance**: All files ≤80 lines through L2-MODULAR extraction
- **Placement System**: 100% placement system functionality preserved
- **Decision Intelligence**: Complete visual decision tree and flowchart system maintained
- **Conversation-First**: UX patterns for natural conversation preserved

## DOMAIN SCOPE
**Target Directory**: `context/architecture/ux/`
**Primary Violations**: ~25 files requiring L2-MODULAR extraction
**Critical Systems**: Component decision flowchart, placement guide, quick reference
**Cross-References**: Placement system integration and conversation-first development

## EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY

### Phase 1: UX Hub Architecture Creation
- Optimize main UX files as reference hubs (≤80 lines each)
- Preserve essential placement system navigation and decision intelligence
- Maintain conversation-first development patterns through hub structure
- Implement systematic UX categorization and cross-references

### Phase 2: Placement System Module Extraction
- Extract placement guide components to specialized modules under `ux/`
- Maintain complete placement system functionality through modular architecture
- Ensure each module ≤80 lines while preserving placement intelligence
- Preserve visual decision tree and flowchart system functionality

### Phase 3: UX Integration Architecture
- Update placement system cross-references to new modular structure
- Implement placement navigation through hub-module architecture
- Validate complete placement system with all decision pathways
- Test conversation-first development patterns and user experience

### Phase 4: Placement System Validation
- Verify 100% placement system functionality preservation
- Confirm complete visual decision tree and flowchart functionality
- Validate conversation-first development pattern preservation
- Test all placement pathways and decision intelligence systems

## UX SYSTEM PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS
**Placement System**: Complete content placement functionality REQUIRED
**Visual Decision Tree**: Flowchart system functionality MANDATORY
**Conversation-First**: Natural conversation patterns PRESERVED
**Decision Intelligence**: Placement wizard and quick reference MAINTAINED

## INTEGRATION DEPENDENCIES
**Parallel Ready**: Independent domain scope enables parallel execution with other H6B splits
**Placement Critical**: UX system affects content placement across entire system
**Cross-Handoff Integration**: Placement patterns used by all other system components

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL
1. **UX System Analysis**: Document current placement system structure and decision pathways
2. **Hub Creation**: Create UX hubs maintaining complete placement functionality
3. **Module Extraction**: Extract placement components using L2-MODULAR methodology
4. **System Integration**: Update placement navigation to new modular structure
5. **Functionality Testing**: Confirm 100% placement system and conversation-first preservation

## QUALITY GATES
- **Pre-Extraction**: Complete documentation of placement system and decision pathways
- **During Extraction**: Real-time placement system functionality monitoring
- **Post-Extraction**: Systematic validation of all UX and placement functionality
- **Integration**: Complete placement system coordination without functionality loss
