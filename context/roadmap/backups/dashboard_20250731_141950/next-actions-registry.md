# Next Actions Registry - Priority Planning Authority

**31/07/2025 13:15 CDMX** | L2-MODULAR extraction from ROADMAP_REGISTRY.md

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/roadmap/ROADMAP_REGISTRY.md â†’ dashboard/next-actions-registry.md implements priority planning per dashboard authority

## ðŸŽ¯ COMPLETE NEXT ACTIONS FRAMEWORK

### Priority 1: P0B CONTINUATION HANDOFF READY
â†’ **handoffs/p0b/README.md** modular handoff system available for immediate execution  
**Status**: 73% â†’ 100% completion path documented with 6 specific handoffs identified  
**Impact**: Unlocks 7 critical issues and P1-P7 phases sequential cascade

### Priority 2: Core Factorization Phase 1  
Start H-SCRIPTS-INV + H-CORE-ANALYSIS (independent of P0B bottleneck)
**Benefit**: /core command modularization (103 lines â†’ dispatcher + 6 subcomandos)
**Features**: Conditional loading, graceful degradation, hook integration

### Priority 3: Hook Integration Next Phase  
Execute H-HOOK-INTEGRATION with PC-PARALLEL foundation (post-edit enhancement)
**Dependency**: H-SCRIPTS-CLASS completion required
**Integration**: PC-PARALLEL coordination protocols validated

### Priority 4: Independent Issues Execution
Work on 8 independent issues parallel anytime (#13, #10, #11, #19, #21, #7, #8, #9)
**Advantage**: No dependency blocking, immediate execution capability
**Impact**: Parallel progress while addressing P0B bottleneck

## ACTIONS ANALYSIS

### ðŸ”§ Core Factorization Initiative
**9 H-handoffs**: /core command modularization framework
**Phase 1 Ready**: H-SCRIPTS-INV + H-CORE-ANALYSIS parallel execution capability
**Architecture**: Dispatcher pattern with 6 specialized subcommands
**Benefits**: Conditional loading + graceful degradation + hook integration

### ðŸš€ Execution Strategy
**Immediate**: P0B handoff system (modular, documented, ready)
**Parallel**: Core factorization Phase 1 (independent of P0B)
**Sequential**: Hook integration (post-P0B dependency resolution)
**Continuous**: Independent issues (8 available anytime)

### ðŸ“Š Impact Metrics
**P0B Completion**: Unlocks 18 blocked items (7 issues + P1-P7 phases)
**Core Factorization**: 103 lines â†’ modular dispatcher architecture
**Independent Track**: 8 issues immediate execution without blocking
