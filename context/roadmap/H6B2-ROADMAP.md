# H6B2-ROADMAP - Roadmap System L2-MODULAR Extraction

**31/07/2025 CDMX** | L2-MODULAR extraction for context/roadmap/ violations

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/architecture/core/truth-source.md → H6B2-ROADMAP implements roadmap system L2-MODULAR extraction per Work Item Density Patterns split strategy

## HANDOFF OBJECTIVE
**Execute L2-MODULAR extraction for context/roadmap/ directory** resolving ~15 file size violations while preserving dashboard functionality and work item tracking through reference hub architecture.

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- **Size Compliance**: All files ≤80 lines through L2-MODULAR extraction
- **Dashboard Functionality**: 100% roadmap dashboard functionality preserved
- **Work Item Tracking**: Complete work item and issue tracking maintained
- **Reference Integrity**: Cross-references to work items maintained post-extraction

## DOMAIN SCOPE
**Target Directory**: `context/roadmap/`
**Primary Violations**: ~15 files requiring L2-MODULAR extraction
**Critical Files**: ROADMAP_REGISTRY.md (dashboard authority), individual work item files
**Cross-References**: Dashboard navigation and work item coordination

## EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY

### Phase 1: Dashboard Hub Optimization
- Optimize ROADMAP_REGISTRY.md as reference hub (≤80 lines) with complete dashboard navigation
- Preserve essential dashboard functionality and work item status tracking
- Maintain cross-references to all work items and issue tracking
- Implement systematic work item categorization and progress visualization

### Phase 2: Work Item Module Extraction
- Extract large work item files to specialized modules under `roadmap/`
- Maintain complete work item functionality through modular architecture
- Ensure each work item file ≤80 lines through scope-focused extraction
- Preserve work item dependencies and sequential logic

### Phase 3: Dashboard Integration Architecture
- Update dashboard cross-references to new modular structure
- Implement work item navigation through hub-module architecture
- Validate dashboard functionality with all work item integrations
- Test complete roadmap coordination and progress tracking

### Phase 4: Work Item Validation
- Verify 100% dashboard functionality preservation through systematic testing
- Confirm complete work item tracking and status management
- Validate work item dependencies and coordination protocols
- Test all cross-reference pathways for dashboard navigation

## DASHBOARD AUTHORITY PRESERVATION
**ROADMAP_REGISTRY.md Authority**: Complete roadmap coordination and work item tracking
**Work Item Dependencies**: Sequential/parallel execution logic maintained
**Issue Integration**: GitHub issue coordination preserved through modular structure
**Progress Tracking**: Dashboard metrics and status visualization maintained

## INTEGRATION DEPENDENCIES
**Parallel Ready**: Independent domain scope enables parallel execution with other H6B splits
**Dashboard Critical**: Roadmap coordination affects all other work items
**Cross-Handoff Impact**: Dashboard updates required as other handoffs modify work items

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL
1. **Dashboard Analysis**: Document current dashboard structure and work item references
2. **Hub Optimization**: Optimize ROADMAP_REGISTRY.md as reference hub with complete functionality
3. **Module Extraction**: Extract large work item files using L2-MODULAR methodology
4. **Dashboard Integration**: Update dashboard navigation to new modular structure
5. **Functionality Testing**: Confirm 100% dashboard and work item tracking preservation

## QUALITY GATES
- **Pre-Extraction**: Complete documentation of dashboard functionality and work item references
- **During Extraction**: Real-time dashboard functionality monitoring
- **Post-Extraction**: Systematic validation of all dashboard and work item functionality
- **Integration**: Complete roadmap coordination without functionality loss

---

**H6B2-ROADMAP AUTHORITY**: Roadmap system L2-MODULAR extraction preserving complete dashboard functionality and work item coordination through validated modular architecture.

**EXECUTION TIMELINE**: 1-2 days focused extraction with dashboard preservation priority
**CRITICAL IMPACT**: Dashboard coordination affects system-wide work item tracking
