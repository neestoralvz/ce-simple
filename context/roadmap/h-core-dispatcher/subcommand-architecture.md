# Subcommand Architecture - Delegation Framework Module

**31/07/2025 CDMX** | Specialized subcommand coordination and delegation protocols

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
H-CORE-DISPATCHER.md → subcommand-architecture.md implements subcommand coordination per L2-MODULAR methodology

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"6 specialized subcommands with coordinated delegation and workflow intelligence"** - Complete subcommand ecosystem with intelligent coordination and cross-component workflow management.

## SUBCOMMAND ARCHITECTURE FRAMEWORK

### **6 Specialized Subcommands**

#### **/core-workspace**: Workspace Management
- **Primary Function**: Environment setup, git worktree management, workspace initialization
- **Trigger Patterns**: `workspace|setup|environment|git|worktree`
- **Delegation Protocol**: First-stage setup for complex workflows
- **Integration**: Foundation for orchestration and scope management

#### **/core-decision**: Decision Intelligence
- **Primary Function**: Complexity analysis, workflow routing, decision matrix evaluation
- **Trigger Patterns**: `decide|route|complexity|analysis|choose`
- **Delegation Protocol**: Workflow type determination (DIRECT vs ORQUESTA)
- **Integration**: Central routing hub for all other subcommands

#### **/core-orchestrate**: L4-Pure Orchestration
- **Primary Function**: Multi-component coordination, parallel workflow management
- **Trigger Patterns**: `orchestrate|coordinate|complex|multi|parallel`
- **Delegation Protocol**: Complex workflow coordination and handoff management
- **Integration**: Coordinates scope, validation, and finalization

#### **/core-scope**: GitHub Scope Management
- **Primary Function**: Issue tracking, scope expansion, GitHub integration
- **Trigger Patterns**: `scope|expand|issue|track`
- **Delegation Protocol**: Continuous scope monitoring during orchestration
- **Integration**: Real-time scope adjustment and issue management

#### **/core-validate**: Quality Gates
- **Primary Function**: Validation protocols, quality assurance, compliance checking
- **Trigger Patterns**: `validate|quality|check|verify`
- **Delegation Protocol**: Continuous validation during workflow execution
- **Integration**: Quality gates for all workflow stages

#### **/core-finalize**: Conversation Finalization
- **Primary Function**: Workflow completion, conversation extraction, handoff preparation
- **Trigger Patterns**: `finalize|complete|finish|close`
- **Delegation Protocol**: Final workflow stage with extraction and cleanup
- **Integration**: Completion verification and next-step preparation

## DELEGATION COORDINATION FRAMEWORK

### **Cross-Subcommand Workflow Intelligence**
- **Sequential Coordination**: Ordered execution for complex multi-stage workflows
- **Parallel Execution**: Simultaneous subcommand execution when appropriate
- **State Management**: Workflow state preservation across subcommand transitions
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic dependency management between subcommands

### **Workflow Coordination Patterns**
- **Simple Workflow**: Decision → Single Subcommand → Finalization
- **Complex Workflow**: Workspace → Decision → Orchestration → Scope + Validation → Finalization
- **Adaptive Workflow**: Dynamic routing based on task complexity and context analysis
