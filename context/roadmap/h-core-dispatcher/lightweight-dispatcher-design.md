# Lightweight Dispatcher Design - Core Architecture Module

**31/07/2025 CDMX** | Dispatcher optimization and performance architecture

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
H-CORE-DISPATCHER.md → lightweight-dispatcher-design.md implements dispatcher optimization per L2-MODULAR methodology

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"≤30 lines intelligent dispatcher with 100% functionality preservation"** - Extreme optimization through L2-MODULAR reference architecture maintaining complete routing intelligence.

## LIGHTWEIGHT DISPATCHER FRAMEWORK

### **Core Dispatcher Architecture**
- **Primary Function**: Intelligent semantic pattern recognition and routing delegation
- **Target Size**: ≤30 lines maximum for optimal token efficiency
- **Routing Intelligence**: Reference-based delegation to specialized routing logic
- **Performance Focus**: Minimal context loading with maximum routing accuracy

### **Design Principles**
- **Reference-Only Architecture**: Core dispatcher contains only routing references
- **Semantic Pattern Recognition**: Lightweight pattern matching for subcommand delegation
- **Intelligent Delegation**: Smart routing to appropriate specialized subcommands
- **Zero Functionality Loss**: Complete preservation of existing routing capabilities

## DISPATCHER OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY

### **Token Efficiency Framework**
- **Context Loading Optimization**: Conditional loading based on conversation patterns
- **Reference Architecture**: Specialized logic extracted to dedicated modules
- **Performance Metrics**: 60-80% token reduction through intelligent modularity
- **Execution Speed**: Faster routing through optimized pattern recognition

### **Architecture Benefits**
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Individual module updates without core modification
- **Scalability Enhancement**: Easy addition of new routing patterns
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimal resource consumption with maximum functionality
- **Evolution Compatibility**: Organic growth support through modular architecture
