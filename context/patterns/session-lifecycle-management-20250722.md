# Session Lifecycle Management Pattern

## Discovered Patterns

### 1. Complexity-Based Activation Pattern
**Context**: Determine when to activate session isolation automatically
**Pattern**: Use complexity thresholds (≥6) to trigger work tree initialization
**Evidence**: Multi-component workflows benefit from isolation while simple tasks remain streamlined
**Application**: Scalable to any workflow requiring conditional resource activation

### 2. Intelligent Decision Framework Pattern  
**Context**: Automate complex decisions with user override capabilities
**Pattern**: Score-based assessment + user prompt when threshold not met
**Evidence**: Auto-merge criteria (conflicts, files, duration) + manual review option
**Application**: Any binary decision requiring safety checks and user control

### 3. Session State Management Pattern
**Context**: Track workflow progress across isolated environments
**Pattern**: Metadata files (.session-info) with structured state tracking
**Evidence**: Session ID, timestamps, complexity scores, completion status
**Application**: Extensible to any stateful workflow requiring progress tracking

### 4. Lifecycle Integration Pattern
**Context**: Seamlessly integrate new capabilities into existing workflows  
**Pattern**: Enhance existing commands rather than create parallel systems
**Evidence**: /start command enhanced with work tree lifecycle rather than separate system
**Application**: Maintains user experience while adding powerful capabilities

## Decision Points

### Multi-Command Architecture Decision
**Alternative Considered**: Single monolithic command vs. specialized command trio
**Chosen**: Specialized commands (/worktree-start, /worktree-close, /worktree-cleanup)
**Rationale**: Separation of concerns, testability, and targeted functionality
**Outcome**: Clear responsibilities and flexible usage patterns

### Auto-Activation Threshold Decision  
**Alternative Considered**: Always manual vs. always automatic vs. threshold-based
**Chosen**: Complexity ≥6 threshold with manual override
**Rationale**: Balances automation benefits with user control
**Outcome**: Invisible for simple workflows, automatic for complex ones

### Session Metadata Scope Decision
**Alternative Considered**: Minimal tracking vs. comprehensive metadata
**Chosen**: Comprehensive metadata with JSON structure
**Rationale**: Enables intelligent decision-making and future enhancements
**Outcome**: Rich data for auto-merge decisions and maintenance

## Success Factors

### 1. Progressive Enhancement Approach
- Existing workflows unchanged for simple cases
- Complex workflows gain powerful isolation capabilities
- No breaking changes to established patterns

### 2. Evidence-Based Decision Criteria
- Auto-merge rules based on objective measures (conflicts, file count, duration)
- User retains control through manual override options
- Clear scoring framework for consistent decision-making

### 3. Comprehensive Lifecycle Coverage
- Initialization, management, completion, and maintenance phases
- Orphan detection and cleanup prevents system pollution
- Integration with existing git workflows and commands

### 4. Metadata-Driven Intelligence
- Session tracking enables smart decision-making
- Complexity scoring guides activation and closure decisions
- Rich context for future workflow optimization

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Conflict Resolution Enhancement
- Could integrate more sophisticated merge conflict resolution
- Potential for automatic resolution of simple conflicts
- Better visualization of merge impact

### 2. Session Analytics
- Usage patterns could inform threshold adjustments
- Success/failure rates could guide optimization
- User behavior analysis for workflow improvements

### 3. Advanced Orchestration
- Multiple parallel work trees for related features
- Cross-session dependency tracking
- Collaborative work tree management
