# Error Detection & Problem-Solving Integration Standards

## 🎯 Automatic Integration Framework

### Universal Error Detection Protocol
**Integration Pattern**: All commands enhanced with automatic error detection and problem-solving workflow activation

#### Error Classification Framework
```
CRITICAL: System failures, command execution failures, corrupted states
HIGH: Functional failures, significant performance degradation, data issues  
MEDIUM: Partial failures, warning conditions, suboptimal performance
LOW: Minor issues, configuration warnings, cosmetic problems
```

#### Auto-Trigger Conditions
**Command Execution Failures**:
- Tool execution returning error codes
- Exception handling activation
- Timeout conditions exceeded
- Resource access failures

**System Health Degradation**:
- Performance metrics below threshold
- Memory/resource exhaustion indicators
- Integration failures between components
- Data integrity violations

**User Experience Issues**:
- Unexpected command behavior reported
- Results not matching expected outcomes
- Workflow interruption or termination
- Configuration or setup failures

### Integration Points in Existing Commands

#### Enhanced `/start` Command Integration
```
🔧 ERROR DETECTION: Monitor workflow execution for failures
⚡ AUTO-TRIGGER: Launch /problem-solving when critical issues detected
🔄 CONTEXT PRESERVATION: Pass workflow context to problem-solving analysis
📊 ESCALATION: Automatic problem-solving activation on threshold breach
```

#### Enhanced `/explore-codebase` Integration
```
🔍 SEARCH FAILURES: File access, permission, or pattern matching issues  
📁 CONTEXT ERRORS: Missing dependencies or broken references
⚡ AUTO-RESOLUTION: Trigger problem-solving for systematic investigation
```

#### Enhanced `/explore-web` Integration
```
🌐 CONNECTION FAILURES: Network issues, API failures, timeout conditions
📚 RESEARCH GAPS: Insufficient results or search strategy failures
⚡ FALLBACK ACTIVATION: Problem-solving for alternative research approaches
```

#### Enhanced `/docs-workflow` Integration
```
📊 HEALTH FAILURES: Critical system health score degradation
🔧 OPTIMIZATION FAILURES: Recursive correction reaching maximum iterations
⚡ SYSTEMATIC RESOLUTION: Problem-solving for complex documentation issues
```

### Automatic Activation Logic

#### Detection Algorithm
```javascript
function detectAndTriggerProblemSolving(commandContext, executionResult) {
    const errorScore = calculateErrorSeverity(executionResult);
    const systemImpact = assessSystemImpact(commandContext);
    const userExperience = evaluateUserImpact(executionResult);
    
    const totalScore = errorScore + systemImpact + userExperience;
    
    if (totalScore >= CRITICAL_THRESHOLD) {
        return triggerProblemSolving('critical', commandContext, executionResult);
    } else if (totalScore >= HIGH_THRESHOLD) {
        return triggerProblemSolving('high', commandContext, executionResult);
    } else if (userReportedIssue || repeatedFailure) {
        return triggerProblemSolving('user-initiated', commandContext, executionResult);
    }
    
    return continueNormalExecution();
}
```

#### Context Preservation Framework
**Error Context Package**:
```
{
    originatingCommand: string,
    executionContext: object,
    errorDetails: {
        type: string,
        severity: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low',
        message: string,
        stackTrace?: string,
        systemState: object
    },
    environmentContext: {
        timestamp: string,
        systemLoad: object,
        resourceUsage: object,
        recentChanges: array
    },
    userContext: {
        currentWorkflow: string,
        expectedOutcome: string,
        previousActions: array
    }
}
```

### Notification Enhancement

#### Error Detection Notifications
```
⚠️ ERROR-DETECTED: [severity] issue in [command] → Analyzing impact
🔍 DIAGNOSIS-INITIATED: Problem-solving workflow activated → [error-type]  
⚡ AUTO-RESOLUTION: Systematic investigation launched → Expected resolution in [timeframe]
📊 ESCALATION: Complex issue identified → Expert analysis activated
```

#### Problem-Solving Integration Notifications  
```
🔧 PROBLEM-SOLVING: Activated from [origin-command] → [5-phase workflow]
📁 CONTEXT-PRESERVED: Error details + execution state → Comprehensive analysis  
🧠 ENHANCED-ANALYSIS: Think-layers problem-solving mode → Solution-focused investigation
✅ RESOLUTION-READY: Solution plan generated → Return to [origin-command] workflow
```

### Integration Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Core Command Enhancement
- Add error detection logic to `/start`, `/explore-codebase`, `/explore-web`
- Implement automatic trigger mechanisms with context preservation
- Test integration with problem-solving workflow activation

#### Phase 2: Specialized Command Integration  
- Enhance documentation workflow commands with systematic error handling
- Add performance monitoring and automatic problem-solving triggers
- Implement user-reported issue handling with workflow activation

#### Phase 3: System-Wide Error Monitoring
- Global error detection across all commands and system components
- Comprehensive logging and error tracking for pattern analysis
- Predictive error detection based on system health metrics

### Quality Assurance

#### Integration Validation
- **No False Positives**: Ensure legitimate command variations don't trigger error detection
- **Context Accuracy**: Verify error context preservation maintains all necessary information
- **Performance Impact**: Minimize overhead of error detection on normal command execution
- **Recovery Capability**: Ensure system can recover gracefully from problem-solving workflow

#### Success Metrics
- **Detection Accuracy**: >95% correct error identification and severity assessment
- **Resolution Efficiency**: <30% time increase for error resolution vs manual debugging
- **User Experience**: Seamless transition between normal execution and problem-solving
- **System Stability**: No degradation in overall command system performance
