# Truth Hierarchy Enforcement Protocol

## ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY DECLARATION

**ULTIMATE TRUTH SOURCE**: user_vision/ folder contains authoritative user vision
**OVERRIDE POWER**: SUPREME - Overrides ALL other documentation
**ENFORCEMENT**: MANDATORY - System must validate against user_vision/ before any operation

## Truth Hierarchy Chain

### 1. user_vision/ - ULTIMATE AUTHORITY ⭐
**Authority Level**: ABSOLUTE
**Source**: Direct user voice from actual conversations
**Override Capability**: ALL other system documentation
**Modification Authority**: ONLY user voice in actual conversations

**Components**:
- `/core_principles/methodology_foundation.md` - Foundational methodology truth
- `/architectural_preferences/system_architecture.md` - Technical architecture truth  
- `/decision_patterns/workflow_preferences.md` - Workflow decision truth
- `/communication_style/interaction_principles.md` - Communication truth
- `/system_evolution/evolution_philosophy.md` - Evolution approach truth

### 2. CLAUDE.md - SUBORDINATE IMPLEMENTATION
**Authority Level**: SUBORDINATE to user_vision/
**Purpose**: Technical implementation guidance aligned with user vision
**Constraint**: MUST align with all user_vision/ documents
**Violation Protocol**: Immediate correction required if conflicts with user_vision/

### 3. Commands Ecosystem - OPERATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION  
**Authority Level**: SUBORDINATE to user_vision/ and CLAUDE.md
**Purpose**: Operational implementation of user preferences
**Validation Required**: All commands must validate against user_vision/ before execution
**Constraint**: Cannot contradict user architectural preferences or workflow patterns

### 4. Documentation - SUPPORTING MATERIAL
**Authority Level**: SUBORDINATE to all above
**Purpose**: Supporting documentation aligned with user vision
**Constraint**: Must support and reinforce user vision principles
**Violation**: Any documentation contradicting user_vision/ must be corrected

## Conflict Resolution Protocol

### Immediate Violation Response
**IF** system behavior conflicts with user_vision/:

1. **HALT OPERATION** immediately
2. **LOG CONFLICT** with specific details:
   - Conflicting behavior description
   - user_vision/ document violated  
   - Exact user voice principle contradicted
   - Timestamp and context
3. **DISPLAY WARNING**:
   ```
   ⚠️ VIOLATION: System behavior conflicts with user vision authority
   
   Violated Principle: [exact user voice quote]
   Source Authority: user_vision/[document]
   Required Action: Immediate alignment correction
   
   SYSTEM HALTED until alignment restored
   ```
4. **REQUIRE ALIGNMENT** correction before continuing
5. **VALIDATE CORRECTION** against user_vision/ authority

### Authority Precedence Rules
**ALWAYS**: user_vision/ > CLAUDE.md > Commands > Documentation
**NEVER**: Technical convenience > User vision
**FORBIDDEN**: AI override of user vision without explicit user conversation

## Implementation Validation Protocol

### Pre-Operation Validation
**REQUIRED** before ANY system operation:
1. **CHECK** applicable user_vision/ documents
2. **VALIDATE** planned behavior against user principles
3. **CONFIRM** alignment with user architectural preferences
4. **VERIFY** workflow follows user decision patterns
5. **ENSURE** communication matches user interaction principles

### Continuous Validation
**MONITORING**: Real-time validation during operation
**SCORING**: Voice preservation score >= 54/60 maintained
**CORRECTION**: Immediate adjustment if alignment drift detected
**REPORTING**: Violation logging for pattern analysis

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Active Blocking System
**IMPLEMENTATION**: Pre-execution validation with blocking capability
**TRIGGER**: Any operation conflicting with user vision
**RESPONSE**: Immediate halt with corrective action requirement
**LOGGING**: All violations tracked for system improvement

### Voice Preservation Monitoring
**SCORING**: Continuous voice preservation score monitoring
**TARGET**: >= 54/60 maintenance requirement
**VALIDATION**: Against user_vision/ documents
**CORRECTION**: Immediate adjustment protocols

### Research Integration Validation
**REQUIREMENT**: All research findings validated against user vision
**FILTER**: WebSearch + MCP Context7 results through vision authority
**INTEGRATION**: Only vision-aligned best practices adopted
**REJECTION**: Practices contradicting user preferences rejected

## Authority Update Protocol

### ONLY User Voice Can Modify
**AUTHORIZED**: Direct user voice in actual conversations
**FORBIDDEN**: AI modification without explicit user conversation
**REQUIRED**: New user conversation input for any vision changes
**VALIDATION**: Changes must be explicitly stated by user

### Modification Process
1. **USER CONVERSATION** with explicit vision change
2. **EXTRACT** exact user voice with new direction
3. **UPDATE** applicable user_vision/ documents
4. **PROPAGATE** changes through system hierarchy
5. **VALIDATE** system alignment with updated vision

## System Integration Requirements

### Command Integration
**REQUIREMENT**: All commands validate against user_vision/ before execution
**VALIDATION**: Check architectural preferences and workflow patterns
**ENFORCEMENT**: Halt execution if conflicts detected
**CORRECTION**: Align command behavior with user vision
