# Transparency Requirements - User Vision

**Date**: 2025-07-26  
**Type**: Critical technical requirement - Sacred User Space  
**Status**: User-identified limitation requiring immediate implementation

## Core Transparency Requirement

**User Need**: "El agente principal debe notificarme de los resultados de los subagentes desplegados, porque si los subagentes desplegados solo le devuelven resultados al agente principal, yo necesito también tener esa información."

## Technical Problem Identified

**Task Tool Limitation**: When commands deploy parallel sub-agents via Task Tool:
- Sub-agents return results only to main agent
- User sees only final synthesis, not individual agent work
- Process visibility is lost, reducing user control and understanding
- Cannot verify individual agent quality or troubleshoot specific failures

## User Vision for Solution

**Complete Process Transparency**: "I need to see what each sub-agent is doing and what results they produce, not just the final summary."

**Individual Agent Reporting**: Each deployed sub-agent must report its results directly to the user before synthesis
**Progress Visibility**: User should see real-time progress of parallel operations
**Result Traceability**: Clear attribution of which agent produced which insights
**Quality Control**: User can evaluate individual agent performance and identify issues

## Implementation Requirements

### Command Structure with Transparency
```
User Request → Command Analysis → Sub-agent Deployment 
    ↓
Individual Agent Results Reported to User (Agent 1, Agent 2, etc.)
    ↓  
Result Synthesis → Final Integrated Response → User Delivery
```

### Required Reporting Pattern
1. **Pre-deployment**: "Deploying X agents for parallel execution..."
2. **Individual Results**: Each agent reports directly to user with clear labeling
3. **Progress Updates**: Real-time status of parallel operations
4. **Synthesis**: Main agent combines results with clear source attribution
5. **Completion**: Summary with performance metrics and agent contributions

### User Control Requirements
- **Override Capability**: User can interrupt or redirect individual agents
- **Quality Assessment**: User can evaluate each agent's contribution
- **Debugging**: Clear visibility when specific agents fail or underperform
- **Learning**: User understands system operation for future optimization

## Technical Architecture Implications

**Task Tool Enhancement Need**: Commands must be structured to:
- Deploy sub-agents with explicit user reporting
- Maintain real-time communication with user during parallel execution
- Provide clear progress indicators and intermediate results
- Enable user intervention and quality control

**Performance Balance**: Transparency must not sacrifice parallelization benefits
**User Experience**: Information must be clearly organized, not overwhelming

## Success Criteria

**Full Visibility**: User sees all sub-agent work and results individually
**Clear Attribution**: Each insight/result clearly attributed to source agent
**Process Control**: User can understand, monitor, and influence parallel execution
**Quality Assurance**: User can evaluate and improve individual agent performance

**User Truth**: Task Tool parallelization is only valuable if the user maintains complete visibility and control over the parallel processes.
