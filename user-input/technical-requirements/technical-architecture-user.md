# Technical Architecture - User Vision

**Date**: User's original vision for technical architecture and execution  
**Type**: Pure user conceptual input - Sacred User Space  
**Status**: Protected from AI modification

## User's Core Execution Mechanism Vision

**Task Tool Integration**: "Claude Code's Task Tool provides core execution foundation:
- Parallel execution of up to 10 sub-agents per command
- Each sub-agent has access to Read/Write/Edit/Bash tools  
- Sub-agents cannot spawn additional tasks or invoke slash commands
- Clear output formats & graceful error handling"

**User's Execution Flow**: "User Request → Command Analysis → Sub-agent Deployment → Parallel Execution WITH INDIVIDUAL AGENT REPORTING → Result Synthesis → User Delivery"

**User Visibility Requirements**: "Critical: I must see results from each sub-agent individually, not just final synthesis. Each deployed agent must report its work directly to me before integration."

## User's Technical Constraints & Solutions

**Autocontainment Requirement**: "Commands MUST be self-contained due to technical limitations:
- Sub-agents have no access to other commands or external files
- All logic, patterns, templates must be embedded inline
- Context & instructions passed explicitly to sub-agents
- No external dependencies or configuration requirements"

**Git WorkTrees for Parallel Development**: "Enable conflict-free parallel operations:
- Isolated file operations preventing merge conflicts
- Multiple agents working on same codebase simultaneously  
- Clean integration & session management
- Automated cleanup & maintenance protocols"

## User's Quality Assurance Architecture Vision

**PTS Framework**: "12-component technical validation system:
- Technical Cluster: Directness, Precision, Sufficiency, Excellence
- Communication Cluster: Exactitude, Sobriety, Structure, Conciseness
- Cognitive Cluster: Clarity, Coherence, Effectiveness, Pragmatism"

**Error Recovery Framework**: "Built-in fault tolerance:
- Phase-level recovery with rollback to stable checkpoints
- Command-level recovery with alternative routing
- System-level recovery with comprehensive failure analysis
- 95%+ automatic recovery without human intervention"

**Process Transparency Framework**: "Complete visibility into parallel operations:
- Individual agent progress reporting in real-time
- Clear attribution of results to specific agents
- User ability to monitor, evaluate, and intervene
- Quality control through individual agent assessment"

## User's Performance Architecture Vision

**Git-Based Intelligence**: "Orchestration driven by Git metrics:
- Commit patterns & success indicators for decision making
- Branch lifecycle & merge success rates optimization
- Performance timeline data from Git history analysis
- Autonomous resource allocation based on historical data"

**User's Parallelization Levels**: "Optimized parallel execution:
- Search tasks: 8-16 parallel (20x speedup)
- File operations: 5-10 parallel (10x speedup)  
- Analysis tasks: 4-8 parallel (4x speedup)
- Validation operations: distributed testing (minutes vs hours)"
