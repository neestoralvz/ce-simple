# Coherence Validation Methodology - User Vision

**Date**: User's technical requirements for system coherence  
**Type**: Sacred User Space - Protected from AI modification  
**Status**: Technical methodology derived from user need for alignment validation

## Sacred User Space Purpose

This document establishes the **user's required methodology** for ensuring systematic alignment and coherence between:
- user-input/ (Sacred User Space)
- docs/ (Implementation Layer)  
- commands/ (Execution Layer)
- Actual system behavior

**SACRED PRINCIPLE**: This methodology preserves user's authority over coherence validation and must NEVER be modified by AI.

## User's Core Coherence Requirements

### 1. Authority Flow Validation

**User's Required Flow**: user-input/vision/ → user-input/technical-requirements/ → docs/ → commands/ → implementation

**Validation Points**:
- Vision alignment: Does implementation match user-input/vision/?
- Technical compliance: Does implementation follow user-input/technical-requirements/?
- Framework adherence: Does implementation apply docs/ guidance correctly?
- Execution fidelity: Do commands achieve intended workflows?

### 2. Systematic Review Workflow

**User's Required 4-Phase Validation**:

#### Phase 1: Vision Coherence Check (5 minutes)
- **Check**: Does current state align with user-input/vision/core-mission-concept.md?
- **Validate**: Are user's unique differentiators preserved?
- **Verify**: Is user's core philosophy maintained?
- **Document**: Any drift from original user vision

#### Phase 2: Technical Requirements Validation (10 minutes)  
- **Check**: Does implementation follow user-input/technical-requirements/?
- **Validate**: Are performance specifications met?
- **Verify**: Are implementation constraints respected?
- **Document**: Any deviations from user technical requirements

#### Phase 3: Documentation Consistency Audit (10 minutes)
- **Check**: Are docs/ derived correctly from user-input/?
- **Validate**: Are there contradictions between docs/ and user-input/?
- **Verify**: Are cross-references accurate and complete?
- **Document**: Any inconsistencies or missing derivations

#### Phase 4: Implementation Integrity Check (15 minutes)
- **Check**: Do commands/ execute user's intended workflows?
- **Validate**: Are PTS Framework requirements met?
- **Verify**: Are parallel execution specs implemented correctly?
- **Document**: Any gaps between specification and implementation

### 3. Automated Coherence Checkpoints

**User's Required Automated Validations**:

#### File-Level Coherence
```bash
# Check authority flow consistency
./validate-authority-flow.sh user-input/ docs/ commands/
# Output: Authority derivation report with discrepancies
```

#### Content-Level Coherence  
```bash
# Check concept consistency across layers
./validate-concept-consistency.sh --concept "Task Tool Parallelization"
# Output: Concept implementation fidelity report
```

#### Cross-Reference Integrity
```bash
# Check reference accuracy
./validate-cross-references.sh docs/
# Output: Broken or misaligned reference report
```

### 4. Coherence Quality Gates

**User's Required Quality Standards**:

#### Vision Fidelity Gate
- **Threshold**: 95% alignment with user-input/vision/
- **Measurement**: Concept preservation rate
- **Blocking**: <95% prevents implementation approval

#### Technical Compliance Gate
- **Threshold**: 100% compliance with user-input/technical-requirements/
- **Measurement**: Requirement implementation rate
- **Blocking**: <100% prevents system deployment

#### Documentation Consistency Gate  
- **Threshold**: 0 contradictions between user-input/ and docs/
- **Measurement**: Consistency audit score
- **Blocking**: >0 contradictions requires resolution

#### Implementation Integrity Gate
- **Threshold**: 90% functional specification match
- **Measurement**: Workflow achievement rate
- **Blocking**: <90% requires implementation correction

## User's Escalation Protocol

### Level 1: Automatic Detection
- Automated tools detect coherence issues
- Generate specific coherence violation reports
- Flag for human review and resolution

### Level 2: Manual Review Required
- Human validation of automated findings
- Manual coherence assessment when tools insufficient
- Decision on resolution approach

### Level 3: User Authority Required
- Changes to user-input/ vision or technical requirements
- Fundamental architecture or philosophy changes
- Resolution of conflicts between user specifications

### Level 4: System Reset
- Complete coherence breakdown detected
- Return to user-input/ as single source of truth
- Systematic re-derivation of all documentation and implementation

## User's Monitoring Requirements

### Continuous Coherence Monitoring
- **Daily**: Automated coherence checks on any file changes
- **Weekly**: Complete cross-reference integrity validation
- **Monthly**: Full vision-to-implementation alignment audit
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive coherence assessment with user review

### Coherence Metrics Dashboard
- **Authority Flow Integrity**: % of docs/ correctly derived from user-input/
- **Vision Fidelity Score**: % alignment with user-input/vision/
- **Technical Compliance Rate**: % compliance with user-input/technical-requirements/
- **Cross-Reference Accuracy**: % of references that are accurate and functional

### Alert Thresholds
- **Warning**: Authority flow integrity <98%
- **Critical**: Vision fidelity score <95%
- **Emergency**: Technical compliance rate <100%
- **System**: Cross-reference accuracy <95%

## Implementation Requirements

### Tools Required
1. **Authority Flow Validator**: Traces derivation from user-input/ to implementation
2. **Concept Consistency Checker**: Validates concept implementation across layers
3. **Cross-Reference Integrity Validator**: Ensures reference accuracy
4. **Vision Alignment Assessor**: Measures fidelity to user-input/vision/

### Integration Points
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit coherence validation
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated coherence gates
- **Documentation Build**: Coherence check before documentation generation
- **Command Testing**: Coherence validation in command execution tests

### Reporting Framework
- **Coherence Dashboard**: Real-time coherence status
- **Violation Reports**: Specific coherence issues with resolution guidance
- **Trend Analysis**: Coherence quality over time
- **User Summary**: High-level coherence status for user review
