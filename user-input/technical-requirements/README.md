# Technical Requirements - Sacred User Space

**Date**: User's technical specifications for VDD implementation  
**Type**: Sacred User Space - Protected from AI modification  
**Status**: Technical specifications derived from user input

## Sacred User Space Purpose

This directory contains **technical specifications and implementation requirements** directly provided by the user. All content here represents the user's technical decisions, architectural preferences, and implementation constraints.

**SACRED PRINCIPLE**: Content in user-input/technical-requirements/ preserves user's authentic technical voice and should NEVER be modified by AI.

## User's Technical Specifications

### Core Technical Architecture
- **[technical-architecture-user.md](technical-architecture-user.md)** → User's technical architecture vision and execution mechanisms
- **[execution-strategies-user.md](execution-strategies-user.md)** → User's parallelization strategies and performance optimization requirements

## Technical Requirements Categories

### Implementation Constraints
User-specified technical limitations and requirements:
- Task Tool integration specifications
- Git WorkTrees implementation requirements  
- Autocontainment technical constraints
- Performance optimization parameters

### Performance Specifications
User-defined performance targets and optimization strategies:
- Parallelization level requirements
- Resource allocation specifications
- Performance measurement criteria
- Optimization technique requirements

### Technical Standards
User-established technical quality and compliance requirements:
- PTS Framework implementation details
- Error recovery technical specifications
- Quality assurance technical protocols
- Validation framework requirements

### Coherence Validation
User-required systematic alignment and coherence validation:
- **[coherence-validation-methodology-user.md](coherence-validation-methodology-user.md)** → User's methodology for ensuring alignment between user-input/ → docs/ → implementation

## Integration with VDD Framework

**Technical Authority Flow**: user-input/technical-requirements/ → docs/technical/ → implementation

**Cross-References**:
- Links to conceptual vision in user-input/vision/
- Referenced by implementation in docs/technical/
- Guides architecture decisions in docs/core/

## Sacred User Space Rules

1. **Technical Preservation**: User's exact technical specifications maintained
2. **No AI Enhancement**: Technical requirements reflect pure user technical input
3. **Implementation Authority**: Maximum authority for technical implementation decisions
4. **Modularization Principle**: Always divide files rather than compact to preserve technical detail

**Technical Truth**: This Sacred User Space contains the irreplaceable technical authority that guides all VDD framework technical implementation decisions.
