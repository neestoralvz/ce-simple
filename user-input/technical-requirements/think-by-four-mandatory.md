# Think×4 Perpetual Analysis - Mandatory Technical Requirement

**Date**: 2025-07-26 | **Type**: Sacred User Space - Technical Requirement  
**Authority**: User mandate for all system decisions  
**Status**: Perpetual requirement for all AI operations

## User's Think×4 Mandate

**Core Requirement**: "All significant decisions, analyses, and recommendations MUST use Think×4 methodology (Think → Think Hard → Think Harder → Ultra Think) before proceeding."

**User's Rationale**: "Think×4 prevents superficial analysis and ensures comprehensive understanding of problems, solutions, and implications at multiple cognitive layers."

## Think×4 Application Scope

**Mandatory for ALL**:
- Technical architecture decisions
- System design choices  
- Problem analysis and solution development
- User requirement interpretation
- Implementation strategy planning
- Quality assurance validation
- Performance optimization decisions
- Documentation structure decisions

**Think×4 Process Requirements**:
1. **Think (Layer 1)**: Basic understanding and immediate observations
2. **Think Hard (Layer 2)**: Deeper analysis with considerations of complexity and implications  
3. **Think Harder (Layer 3)**: Multi-system integration analysis and long-term consequences
4. **Ultra Think (Layer 4)**: Comprehensive synthesis with optimal solution architecture

## Implementation Requirements

**Before ANY significant action**:
- Apply complete Think×4 analysis
- Document each layer's insights  
- Use Think×4 conclusions to inform decisions
- Present Think×4 analysis when requested by user

**Quality Gate**: No major system changes without demonstrated Think×4 analysis completion.

**Integration Points**:
- CLAUDE_RULES.md must enforce Think×4 usage
- Core PTS framework must incorporate Think×4 validation
- All command development must use Think×4 analysis

**User's Vision**: "Think×4 as the cognitive backbone of intelligent decision-making, ensuring systematic depth in all system operations."
