# User Context - Sacred User Space

**Date**: User feedback and context preservation system  
**Type**: Sacred User Space - Protected from AI modification  
**Status**: Systematic feedback capture as requested by user

## Sacred User Space Purpose

This directory contains **user feedback sessions and contextual insights** preserved in their original form. All content represents authentic user voice and perspective about VDD framework performance, results, and experiences.

**SACRED PRINCIPLE**: Content in user-input/context/ preserves user's authentic voice and should NEVER be modified by AI.

## User's Feedback Categories

As specifically requested by the user, feedback is organized into:

- **Logros** (Achievements): User-identified successes and accomplishments
- **Desafios** (Challenges): User-experienced challenges and difficulties  
- **Errores** (Errors): User-encountered errors and technical issues
- **Obstaculos** (Obstacles): User-identified blockers and impediments
- **Aprendizajes** (Learnings): User-derived insights and knowledge gained

## Feedback File Structure

**Naming Pattern**: `feedback-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-session.md`

**Content Structure**:
```markdown
# User Feedback Session - [Date/Time]

**Type**: Sacred User Space - User authentic voice preserved
**Session Context**: [Brief session description]

## Achievements (Logros)

## Errors (Errores)
[User's account of errors encountered]

## Obstacles (Obstaculos)
[User's identification of blockers]

## Learnings (Aprendizajes)
[User's insights and knowledge gained]

## VDD Framework Assessment

```

## User's Interview Command

The `/interview-feedback` command implements the user's specific request:

> "Me gustaria que uno de los comandos inicie una entrevista para que pueda realizar retroalimentacion de lo que estoy viendo como resultado"

This command provides systematic feedback capture while preserving the user's authentic voice and perspective.

## Integration with VDD Framework

**Sacred User Space Flow**:
1. User provides feedback via `/interview-feedback`
2. Feedback captured in `user-input/context/` (never modified)
3. AI creates cross-references in `docs/context/` (implementation space)
4. Feedback informs system evolution decisions

## Feedback Evolution Capture

Each session's feedback contributes to:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring themes and issues
- **System Optimization**: Improving VDD framework based on user experience
- **Priority Setting**: User input drives development priorities
- **Success Measurement**: User satisfaction as primary success metric

**Core Truth**: This Sacred User Space preserves authentic user feedback that drives continuous VDD framework evolution and improvement.
