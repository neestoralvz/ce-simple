# Global System - User Vision

**Date**: User's original vision for global command architecture  
**Type**: Pure user conceptual input - Sacred User Space  
**Status**: Protected from AI modification

## User's Global Command Architecture Vision

"Comprehensive system of 86+ autocontained slash commands organized in 15 functional categories (00-14) ready for deployment to any project's global command directory."

## User's Command Categories Philosophy

**User's Vision**: "Commands organized by domain and function:"

**00-core**: "Foundation Infrastructure - Essential operations & primary entry points"
**01-discovery**: "Exploration & Analysis - Requirements understanding & technical analysis"  
**02-planning**: "Strategic Planning - Vision-driven development & strategic workflows"
**03-analysis**: "Assessment & Evaluation - Technical complexity evaluation & frameworks"
**04-execution**: "Implementation & Orchestration - Active development & parallel coordination"
**05-validation**: "Quality Assurance - Comprehensive validation ensuring correctness"
**06-documentation**: "Documentation Management - Documentation maintenance & consistency"
**07-maintenance**: "System Health - System optimization & maintenance operations"
**08-learning**: "Continuous Improvement - Pattern extraction & system optimization"
**09-git**: "Version Control Orchestration - Advanced Git operations & workflow management"
**10-standards**: "Development Guidelines - Standards, templates & development guidelines"
**11-meta**: "System Management - Command development & maintenance operations"  
**12-math**: "Mathematical Operations - Mathematical calculation & computation engines"
**13-search**: "Information Discovery - Advanced search with intelligent filtering"
**14-utils**: "Utility Engines - Core utility engines providing specialized functionality"

## User's Governance Architecture Vision

**User's Nomenclature Standards**: 
- "Rules: Governance protocols for behavior (docs/rules/)"
- "Standards: Technical specifications for implementation (docs/standards/)"
- "Commands: verb-noun pattern for slash commands"
- "Files: topic-type.md pattern (lowercase-hyphenated)"

**User's Authority Hierarchy**: "docs/vision/ (absolute) → rules/CLAUDE_RULES.md (partnership) → docs/core/ (technical) → CLAUDE.md (navigation)"

**User's Flat Structure Principle**: "Maximum 1 directory level. Create when needed (no empty directories). Single purpose per file. Active use only."

## User's System Integration Vision

**Clean Boundaries**: "Self-contained commands referencing each other via slash calls only. Preventing dependency conflicts through architectural isolation."

**Cross-Domain Operation**: "Web development, research, documentation, office work, tenders, general workflow automation."

**Quality Compliance**: "All commands meet PTS 12-component framework. ≤80 lines per command. Complete error handling & user guidance."
