# User Vision - Sacred User Space

**Date**: User's original vision for VDD system  
**Type**: Sacred User Space - Protected from AI modification  
**Status**: Complete user vision preserved in original form

## Sacred User Space Purpose

This directory contains the **pure, original user vision** for the VDD (Vision Driven Development) framework. All content here represents the user's conceptual ideas, philosophy, and requirements in their original form.

**SACRED PRINCIPLE**: Content in user-input/ is NEVER modified by AI except for literal user transcriptions.

## User's Complete Vision Components

### Core Mission & Philosophy
- **[core-mission-concept.md](core-mission-concept.md)** → User's mission statement and unique differentiators
- **[command-philosophy-user.md](command-philosophy-user.md)** → User's command design principles and philosophy
- **[development-methodology-user.md](development-methodology-user.md)** → User's development methodology and workflow preferences

### Technical & System Vision  
- **[technical-architecture-user.md](technical-architecture-user.md)** → User's technical architecture vision
- **[execution-strategies-user.md](execution-strategies-user.md)** → User's parallelization and execution preferences
- **[autonomous-systems-user.md](autonomous-systems-user.md)** → User's vision for autonomous recovery and learning

### Communication & Application Vision
- **[communication-documentation-user.md](communication-documentation-user.md)** → User's documentation and communication philosophy
- **[global-system-user.md](global-system-user.md)** → User's global command architecture vision
- **[application-evolution-user.md](application-evolution-user.md)** → User's domain applications and evolution vision

## User's Authority Declaration

"docs/vision/ serves as absolute North Star. All development decisions reference and align with vision documents. Vision → Core → Implementation (never inverted)."

## User's Success Measure

"When users can accomplish complex multi-hour workflows with single command invocations while maintaining full understanding and control of the process."

## Reading Flow for User Vision

**First Time Understanding**: core-mission-concept → command-philosophy-user → development-methodology-user → technical-architecture-user

**Implementation Planning**: execution-strategies-user → autonomous-systems-user → global-system-user

**Documentation & Evolution**: communication-documentation-user → application-evolution-user

## Sacred User Space Principles

1. **Literal Preservation**: User's exact words and concepts maintained
2. **No AI Enhancement**: Content reflects pure user input without AI interpretation
3. **Original Context**: User's organic, conversational, opinion-based content preserved
4. **Modularization Over Compaction**: Always divide files rather than compact to preserve user information
5. **Irreplaceable Value**: Represents permanent user vision that cannot be reconstructed

---

**Core Truth**: This Sacred User Space contains the irreplaceable, permanent value of the user's true vision for VDD framework. All AI implementation work derives from and serves this vision.
