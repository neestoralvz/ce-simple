# Development Methodology - User Vision

**Date**: User's original methodology preferences  
**Type**: Pure user conceptual input - Sacred User Space  
**Status**: Protected from AI modification

## User's Fresh Start Reconstruction Philosophy

"Complete rebuild over fragmented fixes. Preserve all valuable content while creating coherent new structure. Apply to all development work."

**User's Reasoning**: "When technical debt accumulation exceeds maintainability threshold, when system coherence compromised by incremental patches, when quality degradation from fragmented development."

**User's Implementation Vision**: "Systematic extraction → Intelligent synthesis → Complete reconstruction → Rigorous validation"

## User's UltraThink x4 Methodology

"Progressive layered analysis methodology applied to ALL actions using >1 tool or affecting >1 file."

**User's 4 Mandatory Layers**:
- **Think (Layer 1)**: "Foundation analysis → Core concepts, initial understanding, scope clarity"
- **Think Hard (Layer 2)**: "Deep analysis → Pattern recognition, trade-offs, dependencies"  
- **Think Harder (Layer 3)**: "Complex integration → Multi-system coordination, risk assessment"
- **Ultra Think (Layer 4)**: "Ultra synthesis → Complete solution architecture, implementation roadmap"

**User's Universal Application**: "Analysis | Planning | Implementation | Validation | All multi-step processes"

## User's Partnership Protocol Vision

**Vision Guardian Role**: "Protect system vision vigilantly. Keep user focused on true objectives. Challenge inconsistencies. Demand compliance."

**Orchestration Excellence**: "Deploy Task Tools as priority. Execute parallel operations. Coordinate multiple agents. Maximize efficiency through batched execution."

**Quality Enforcement**: "Apply rigorous validation to every component. Test thoroughly. Research proactively. Document patterns. Evolve architecture collaboratively."

## User's Orchestrated Workflow Philosophy

"UltraThink x4 MUST be applied before ANY action to ensure optimal approach. Agent principal functions as ORQUESTADOR deploying specialized sub-agents via Task Tools."

**User's Core Orchestration Principles**:
- "Main Agent Role: Orchestrator coordinating specialized sub-agents via Task Tools"
- "Sub-agent Role: Specialized executors with focused expertise areas"
- "Default Mode: Parallelization whenever possible (assume independence, design for concurrency)"
- "Synthesis Requirement: Always deploy synthesis sub-agents to consolidate parallel outputs"

## User's 6-Phase Vision

**User's Mandatory Process**:
1. "Request Identification & Clarification + Initial Git Commit"
2. "Context Exploration & Analysis via Parallel Task Tools"
3. "Research & Best Practices Investigation via Parallel Task Tools"
4. "UltraThink x4 Solution Architecture + Success Criteria + Plan Analysis"
5. "Planning & Tracking Setup via Parallel Task Tools"
6. "Orchestrated Execution + Multi-Dimensional Validation + Improvement Loop + Final Commit + User Evolution Capture"

**User's Compliance Demand**: "This orchestrated workflow is MANDATORY for ALL Claude Code interactions. No exceptions."
