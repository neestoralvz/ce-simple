# User Input - Sacred User Space

**Purpose**: This directory contains ALL content directly provided by the user. This is Sacred User Space - AI agents must never modify, interpret, or add content here except for literal transcriptions of user interviews.

## Authority Hierarchy

**user-input/** = **Absolute Authority** - Source of truth for all project decisions
**docs/** = Implementation derived from this source

## Directory Structure

### `/vision/`
Pure conceptual content and philosophy from user:
- Mission statement and core philosophy
- Command design principles and development methodology  
- Communication philosophy and global system vision
- Autonomous systems vision and application evolution
- **Example**: Core mission concept, command philosophy, development methodology

### `/technical-requirements/`
Technical specifications and implementation requirements from user:
- Technical architecture and execution mechanisms
- Parallelization strategies and performance optimization  
- Implementation constraints and technical standards
- Performance targets and resource specifications
- **Example**: Task Tool integration specs, Git WorkTrees requirements

### `/evolution/`
Organic user sessions and framework evolution:
- Major architectural decision sessions (literal transcriptions)
- Organic user conversations and thinking evolution
- Framework refinement discussions and insights
- Natural user voice capturing significant changes
- **Example**: VDD migration decisions, framework architecture sessions

### `/context/`
Structured feedback via interview command:
- Systematic feedback using predefined categories
- Interview-based retrospectives (logros, desafios, errores, obstaculos, aprendizajes)
- VDD framework performance structured assessment
- Regular session-based feedback capture
- **Example**: Weekly retrospectives, structured performance evaluations

## Sacred Space Rules

1. **AI Never Modifies**: Agents cannot edit, improve, or interpret content in this space
2. **User Authority**: Only direct user input or literal transcriptions allowed
3. **Organic Content**: Preserves conversational, unstructured user thoughts
4. **Source of Truth**: Maximum authority for all project creation decisions

## Content Flow

```
User Says Something → user-input/ (literal preservation)
                   ↓
AI Interprets/Implements → docs/ (structured derivatives)
```

**Duplication Expected**: Content appears in both spaces - organic source here, structured implementation in docs/

## Directory Usage Guidelines

### When to Use `/vision/`
- ✅ Core mission and philosophy concepts
- ✅ Command design principles and methodology
- ✅ Communication and documentation philosophy
- ✅ High-level system vision and evolution concepts

### When to Use `/technical-requirements/`
- ✅ Specific technical architecture requirements
- ✅ Performance specifications and optimization targets
- ✅ Implementation constraints and technical standards
- ✅ Tool integration specifications and technical protocols

### When to Use `/evolution/`
- ✅ Major framework decisions or architectural changes
- ✅ Natural user conversations about system evolution  
- ✅ Organic thinking sessions and insights
- ✅ Historical decision context preservation

### When to Use `/context/`
- ✅ Structured interview-based feedback sessions
- ✅ Regular performance retrospectives using predefined categories
- ✅ Systematic VDD framework assessment
- ✅ Periodic user satisfaction measurements

### Content Cross-References
- **Vision** provides philosophical foundation for technical requirements
- **Technical requirements** implement vision concepts with specific constraints
- **Evolution sessions** may reference both vision and technical content  
- **Context sessions** assess both conceptual and technical implementation success

**Current Cross-References**:
- `vision/` (7 files) → Pure conceptual framework and philosophy
- `technical-requirements/` (2 files) → Specific implementation specifications
- `evolution/2025-07-25-23-39-vdd-migration-vision.md` → Establishes VDD architecture and Sacred User Space concept
- `evolution/2025-07-26-00-25-framework-refinements-complete.md` → Refines framework implementation details  
- `context/README.md` → Implements structured feedback system requested in evolution sessions

**Core Principle**: This space preserves the authentic user voice that drives all Vision Driven Development.
