# Structure Evolution Plan - Decision-Tree Navigation Architecture

**30/07/2025 08:10 CDMX** | From 150+ files to decision-tree clarity

## Current Reality Assessment
**197 total files** with complex nested structure causing navigation confusion
**User insight:** "no me es tan claro cuando veo todos los archivos dentro de las carpetas porque no está tan identificado hacia dónde va"

## New Decision-Tree Structure Design

### Vision-Driven Organization

```

## Navigation Principle
**Folder path = Decision tree path = Purpose clarity**

### Decision Flow Examples
- Need vision clarity? → `vision_discovery/conversation_flows/`
- Vision evolved? → `vision_discovery/vision_update_protocols/`
- Ready to build? → `workflow_execution/implementation_flows/`
- System too complex? → `system_evolution/complexity_management/`
- Project context unclear? → `project_context/domain_understanding/`

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Essential File Identification
From current 150+ files, identify ~15-20 files that actually serve discovered vision:
- Core vision principles (VISION.md)
- Essential conversation patterns
- Critical workflow definitions
- System evolution protocols
- Project context templates

### Phase 2: Decision-Tree Reorganization
Move essential content into decision-tree structure:
- Group by purpose, not by implementation detail
- Clear navigation paths based on user intent
- Eliminate architectural abstractions that don't serve vision

### Phase 3: Content Consolidation
Merge fragmented content that serves the same decision point:
- Quote collections → Consolidated wisdom files
- Multiple behavior files → Single clear protocols
- Scattered patterns → Integrated workflows

### Phase 4: Elimination of Overhead
Remove architectural luxury that doesn't serve vision:
- Reference-only files without actual content
- Over-engineered modularity
- Theoretical frameworks unused in practice

## Expected Results

### Before: Navigation Confusion
- 197 files across 20+ nested folders
- Unclear purpose and destination
- Architectural abstractions hiding actual function
- Context loading requires understanding complex reference chains

### After: Decision-Tree Clarity
- ~20 essential files in 4 clear decision categories
- Every folder path tells you where it leads
- Function-first organization
- Direct path from user intent to needed resource

## Implementation Priority
1. **Critical workflows first** - vision_discovery and workflow_execution
2. **System evolution support** - complexity_management and adaptation
3. **Project context structure** - domain understanding and preparation
4. **Content migration and consolidation** - preserving essential wisdom
5. **Overhead elimination** - removing architectural bloat

## Success Criteria
- User can navigate to needed resource in <3 clicks
- Folder names clearly indicate decision outcomes
- No confusion about file purpose or destination
- Preserved essential wisdom without architectural overhead
- System serves vision discovery and implementation efficiently

**Authority**: VISION.md-driven architectural simplification
**Integration**: Supports essential workflows while eliminating complexity
**Evolution**: Structure adapts as vision and needs evolve
