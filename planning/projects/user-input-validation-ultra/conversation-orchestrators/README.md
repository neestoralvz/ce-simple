## Orchestration Capabilities

### Parallel Deployment Management
- Deploy 8-16 specialized agents simultaneously
- Coordinate execution phases with synchronized checkpoints
- Monitor individual agent progress with real-time status updates
- Handle agent failures with automatic recovery and redeployment

### Results Synthesis
- Collect individual agent findings independently
- Resolve validation conflicts through automated arbitration
- Generate comprehensive validation reports with clear attribution
- Present user-facing results with drill-down capabilities

### Performance Optimization
- Git-based intelligence for optimal agent assignment
- Dynamic load balancing based on agent performance
- Continuous learning from validation patterns and outcomes
- Efficiency metrics tracking for ongoing improvement
