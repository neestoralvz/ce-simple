**Updated**: 2025-07-26 | **Authority**: Planning methodology | **Scope**: Complete docs/ optimization

## Planning Overview

**Objective**: Comprehensive auditing and consolidation of docs/ folder structure to eliminate duplication, optimize organization, and implement systematic content architecture.

**Methodology**: 4-Step Content Auditing → Think×4 Analysis → Parallel Execution via Handoffs

## Strategic Context

### Current State Assessment
**docs/ Structure Challenge:**

- Optimal directory structure aligned with system architecture
- Elimination of content duplication without loss of value
- Enhanced navigation and discoverability
- Integration with modular /rules/ system

## 4-Step Content Auditing Methodology

### Step 1: INVENTORY (Complete Content Mapping)
**Objective**: Comprehensive content mapping before any changes

**Process:**
1. **Complete Directory Analysis** - Map all docs/ subdirectories and purposes
2. **Content Inventory** - Catalog all files and their primary purposes
3. **Cross-Reference Mapping** - Identify all internal references and dependencies
4. **Duplication Detection** - Systematic identification of duplicated content
5. **Safety Net Creation** - Complete backup and content preservation strategy

**Deliverables:**
- Complete content inventory with categorization
- Duplication mapping and analysis
- Reference dependency mapping
- Safety net documentation

### Step 2: EXTRACT (Content Preservation)
**Objective**: Preserve all unique content before file elimination

**Process:**
1. **Unique Content Identification** - Isolate all unique content elements
2. **Content Extraction** - Remove unique content from files marked for elimination
3. **Consolidation Preparation** - Organize extracted content for integration
4. **Verification Process** - Confirm no valuable content will be lost
5. **Integration Planning** - Plan how extracted content integrates into new structure

**Deliverables:**
- Extracted unique content catalog
- Integration mapping for extracted content
- Verification documentation
- Content consolidation strategy

### Step 3: CONSOLIDATE (Authoritative Source Creation)
**Objective**: Create authoritative sources with ALL unique content

**Process:**
1. **Authoritative File Design** - Design optimal files containing all unique content
2. **Content Integration** - Merge unique content into consolidated authoritative sources
3. **Structure Optimization** - Organize content within files for optimal navigation
4. **Cross-Reference Update** - Update all references to point to new authoritative sources
5. **Validation Process** - Verify all content properly integrated and accessible

**Deliverables:**
- Consolidated authoritative source files
- Updated cross-reference system
- Content organization within files
- Integration validation documentation

### Step 4: MODULARIZE (Logical Family Organization)
**Objective**: Divide large files into logical families vs compacting

**Process:**
1. **Logical Family Identification** - Identify natural content groupings
2. **Modular Architecture Design** - Design optimal modular file organization
3. **Content Distribution** - Distribute consolidated content into logical modules
4. **Navigation Optimization** - Create efficient discovery and access patterns
5. **System Integration** - Integrate modular structure with overall system architecture

**Deliverables:**
- Modular file architecture
- Optimized navigation system
- Content distribution strategy
- System integration documentation

## Think×4 Analysis Framework

### Think (Layer 1): Foundation Analysis
**Objective**: Core understanding of docs/ auditing requirements

**Analysis Scope:**
- Current docs/ structure and organization patterns
- Content types and their natural groupings
- User navigation patterns and requirements
- Integration requirements with /rules/ system

**Key Questions:**
- What are the primary content categories in docs/?
- How do users currently navigate and discover content?
- What are the natural organizational boundaries?
- How does docs/ integrate with the new /rules/ system?

### Think Hard (Layer 2): Deep Content Analysis
**Objective**: Comprehensive understanding of content relationships

**Analysis Scope:**
- Content duplication patterns and root causes
- Cross-reference dependencies and navigation paths
- Content quality and value assessment
- Integration complexity with existing system

**Key Questions:**
- What content is duplicated and why did duplication occur?
- How are files interconnected through references?
- Which content provides the highest value to users?
- What are the integration challenges with current architecture?

### Think Harder (Layer 3): System Integration Analysis
**Objective**: Multi-system coordination and optimization strategy

**Analysis Scope:**
- Integration with /rules/ modular system
- Impact on CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE_RULES.md imports
- Navigation architecture optimization across entire system
- Long-term scalability and maintenance considerations

**Key Questions:**
- How does docs/ optimization integrate with /rules/ modularization?
- What are the system-wide navigation implications?
- How does this support long-term system scalability?
- What are the maintenance and evolution implications?

### Ultra Think (Layer 4): Ultra Synthesis
**Objective**: Complete optimization architecture and implementation roadmap

**Analysis Scope:**
- Comprehensive docs/ optimization strategy
- Complete implementation roadmap with parallel execution
- Risk mitigation and quality assurance strategy
- Long-term system evolution and maintenance plan

**Key Questions:**
- What is the optimal complete docs/ architecture?
- How can implementation be parallelized for efficiency?
- What are the quality gates and validation requirements?
- How does this support long-term system vision?

## Parallel Execution Strategy

### Handoff-Based Parallel Conversations
**Objective**: Implement docs/ auditing through coordinated parallel execution

**4 Primary Handoffs:**
1. **Context Management Handoff** - Content inventory and mapping
2. **Standards vs Rules Handoff** - Directory separation and organization
3. **Validation Systems Handoff** - Quality assurance and validation frameworks
4. **Directory Structure Handoff** - Architectural optimization and implementation

**Integration Handoff:**
- **Final Integration Handoff** - Coordination and consolidation of all parallel work

### Handoff Coordination Protocol
**Methodology**: Each handoff operates independently while maintaining system coherence

**Coordination Requirements:**
- Clear scope boundaries for each handoff
- Defined integration points between handoffs
- Systematic communication of progress and decisions
- Final integration validation and system coherence verification

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning (Handoffs 1-4)
**Objective**: Complete analysis and planning through parallel execution

**Parallel Execution:**
- Context Management: Inventory and mapping
- Standards vs Rules: Directory analysis and separation strategy
- Validation Systems: Quality framework development
- Directory Structure: Architecture optimization planning

**Duration**: Parallel execution for comprehensive analysis

### Phase 2: Integration and Validation (Integration Handoff)
**Objective**: Coordinate and validate all parallel work

**Integration Activities:**
- Consolidate analysis from all handoffs
- Validate system coherence and integration
- Resolve any conflicts or gaps
- Finalize complete docs/ optimization strategy

**Duration**: Integration validation and finalization

### Phase 3: Implementation Execution
**Objective**: Execute docs/ optimization according to validated plan

**Implementation Activities:**
- Execute 4-step content auditing methodology
- Implement optimized directory structure
- Update all cross-references and navigation
- Validate complete system integration

**Duration**: Systematic implementation with continuous validation
