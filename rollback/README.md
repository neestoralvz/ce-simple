# Migration Rollback System

**System**: ce-simple Comprehensive Rollback Framework  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Purpose**: Complete migration safety and recovery system with automated validation and emergency procedures

## System Overview

This rollback system provides comprehensive protection during migration operations through multiple layers of safety mechanisms, automated validation, and emergency recovery procedures. The system captures detailed state snapshots, monitors system health in real-time, and provides both automated and manual rollback capabilities.

## Quick Start

### Initialize Rollback System
```bash
# Initialize the complete rollback infrastructure
./rollback-manager.sh initialize

# Capture initial system state
./state-capture.sh pre-migration

# Run validation suite
./validation-suite.sh full
```

### During Migration
```bash
# Quick validation check
./validation-suite.sh quick

# Emergency rollback if needed
./rollback-manager.sh rollback pre-migration complete

# Emergency recovery wizard
./recovery-procedures.sh wizard
```

## Core Components

### 1. Rollback Manager (`rollback-manager.sh`)
**Purpose**: Main orchestration system for rollback operations  
**Capabilities**:
- Complete rollback infrastructure initialization
- State snapshot management and restoration
- System validation and integrity checking
- Multi-scope rollback execution (complete/incremental/selective)
- Git integration and monitoring

**Key Commands**:
```bash
./rollback-manager.sh initialize        # Setup rollback system
./rollback-manager.sh capture [name]    # Create state snapshot
./rollback-manager.sh validate         # Check system integrity
./rollback-manager.sh rollback <snapshot> [scope] # Execute rollback
./rollback-manager.sh list             # Show available snapshots
```

- File integrity and permission checking
- Command system functionality testing
- Documentation consistency verification
- Performance monitoring and degradation detection
- Migration-specific state validation
- Emergency condition detection

**Validation Types**:
```bash
./validation-suite.sh full         # Complete system validation
./validation-suite.sh quick        # Fast essential checks
./validation-suite.sh emergency    # Emergency condition detection
```

### 4. Recovery Procedures (`recovery-procedures.sh`)
**Purpose**: Emergency recovery and automated repair system  
**Capabilities**:
- Comprehensive damage assessment with scoring
- Emergency rollback to latest known good state
- Critical file repair and restoration
- Git repository repair and reconstruction
- Command system repair and validation
- System consistency repair and cleanup
- Complete system rebuild from snapshots
- Interactive recovery wizard

**Recovery Types**:
```bash
./recovery-procedures.sh assess        # Damage assessment
./recovery-procedures.sh emergency     # Emergency rollback
./recovery-procedures.sh wizard        # Interactive recovery
./recovery-procedures.sh auto          # Automatic recovery
./recovery-procedures.sh rebuild       # Complete system rebuild
```

## Architecture

### State Management Layers

**Pre-Migration State Capture**:
- Complete file inventory with checksums
- Git repository comprehensive documentation
- Directory structure mapping with metadata
- Critical file content snapshots and backups

**Migration Tracking**:
- Batch-level operation logging
- File-by-file change tracking and validation
- Rollback point markers and checkpoints
- Real-time validation checkpoint results

**Recovery Points**:
- Full system snapshots before migration
- Incremental snapshots between batches
- Critical file backups with integrity verification
- Git stash integration and branch tracking

### Rollback Scope Options

**Complete Rollback**:
- Full system restoration to pre-migration state
- All changes reverted with validation
- Original file structure completely restored
- Git history cleaned and validated

**Incremental Rollback**:
- Per-batch rollback capability
- Selective file restoration with verification
- Partial migration preservation
- Granular control with validation

**Selective Rollback**:
- Individual file restoration
- Directory-specific rollback operations
- Critical file emergency recovery
- Targeted repair procedures with validation

### Decision Framework

The system implements a comprehensive decision matrix based on:
- **Severity Classification**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Automated Triggers**: File system, git repository, validation failures
- **Risk Scoring**: Composite risk assessment (0-100 scale)
- **Manual Decision Support**: Checklists and escalation procedures

See `rollback-decision-criteria.md` for complete decision framework documentation.

## Usage Examples

### Standard Migration Protection

```bash
# 1. Initialize rollback system
./rollback-manager.sh initialize

# 2. Capture pre-migration state
./state-capture.sh pre-migration-complete

# 3. Validate current system
./validation-suite.sh full

# 4. During migration - periodic checks
./validation-suite.sh quick

# 5. If issues detected - emergency rollback
./rollback-manager.sh rollback pre-migration-complete complete

# 6. Post-rollback validation
./validation-suite.sh full
```

### Emergency Recovery Scenario

```bash
# 1. Assess damage
./recovery-procedures.sh assess

# 2. Interactive recovery wizard
./recovery-procedures.sh wizard

# 3. Or automatic recovery based on damage
./recovery-procedures.sh auto

# 4. Validate recovery success
./validation-suite.sh full
```

### Incremental Protection During Migration

```bash
# Create checkpoint before each major operation
./state-capture.sh checkpoint-batch-1
./state-capture.sh checkpoint-batch-2

# Validate after each batch
./validation-suite.sh quick

# Selective rollback if needed
./rollback-manager.sh rollback checkpoint-batch-1 incremental
```
