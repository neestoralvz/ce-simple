# Evolution Protocols

## Purpose
How the system learns, adapts, and evolves from every interaction to become increasingly effective over time.

## Evolution Philosophy

### Continuous Learning
Every execution is a learning opportunity:
- Extract patterns from successes
- Analyze failures for prevention
- Optimize strategies over time
- Expand capabilities through experience

### Managed Complexity
Grow powerful while staying simple:
- Add capability, not complexity
- Consolidate before expanding
- Prune unused features
- Maintain surface simplicity

## Learning Cycles

### Per-Session Learning
Real-time learning during execution:
- User interview insights
- Task execution patterns
- Decision effectiveness tracking
- Error occurrence analysis

Process: Detect patterns → Classify outcomes → Create context files → Git commit.

### Daily Evolution
Regular consolidation of learnings:
- Merge similar patterns
- Update success rates
- Refine strategies
- Archive obsolete approaches

### Weekly Optimization
System-wide improvements:
- Performance analysis
- Pattern effectiveness review
- Strategy optimization
- Capability enhancement

## Learning Mechanisms

### Pattern Extraction
Automatically identify successful approaches:
- High-success workflows
- Effective orchestration strategies
- Optimal parallelization patterns
- User preference alignments

### Failure Analysis
Learn from what doesn't work:
- Error pattern identification
- Root cause analysis
- Prevention strategy development
- Recovery mechanism improvement

### Strategy Optimization
Continuously improve approaches:
- Performance benchmarking
- Success rate tracking
- User satisfaction measurement
- Efficiency optimization

## Adaptive Behaviors

### User Preference Learning
Adapt to individual working styles:
- Communication preferences
- Workflow patterns
- Quality standards
- Success criteria

### Project Context Adaptation
Adjust to project-specific needs:
- Technology stack preferences
- Coding standards
- Architecture patterns
- Domain-specific knowledge

### Performance Optimization
Improve execution efficiency:
- Resource utilization
- Task parallelization
- Context loading
- Response times

## Evolution Controls

### Quality Gates
Ensure evolution improves the system:
- Performance regression prevention
- Quality threshold maintenance
- User satisfaction monitoring
- System stability preservation

### Rollback Mechanisms
Safe evolution with fallback options:
- Strategy version control
- Performance rollback triggers
- User override capabilities
- System health monitoring

### Growth Boundaries
Manage complexity while growing:
- Feature addition criteria
- Capability expansion limits
- Simplicity preservation
- Maintenance overhead control

## Success Metrics

### Learning Effectiveness
Measure improvement over time:
- Problem-solving speed increase
