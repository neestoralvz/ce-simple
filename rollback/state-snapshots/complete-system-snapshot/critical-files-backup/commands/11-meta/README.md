# 11-meta - Meta & System Commands

## Purpose
Meta-level system operations and self-management. These commands handle system introspection, command orchestration, and high-level system coordination across all categories.

## Commands
- `/meta-orchestrate` - Cross-category command orchestration
- `/system-introspect` - System self-analysis and reporting
- `/command-coordinate` - Intelligent command coordination
- `/matrix-maintain` - Cross-reference matrix maintenance
- `/system-evolve` - System-wide evolution and improvements

## Category Relations
- **Coordinates**: All categories through meta-orchestration
- **Uses**: 12-math for system metrics and analysis
- **Reports to**: 00-core for system status and health
- **Feeds into**: 08-learning for meta-pattern capture

## Usage Patterns
```
00-core/start → 11-meta/orchestrate → Multiple-categories
11-meta/introspect → 12-math/analyze → 08-learning/capture
11-meta/matrix → 10-standards/validate → 06-documentation/update
```

## Meta Operations
- **System Orchestration**: Cross-category workflow coordination
- **Command Coordination**: Intelligent command sequencing and parallelization
- **Matrix Management**: Cross-reference validation and maintenance
- **System Evolution**: Meta-level improvements and optimizations

## Orchestration Features
- Multi-category workflow coordination
- Intelligent task dependency resolution
- Resource allocation across categories
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Error handling and recovery at system level

## Meta Intelligence
- System behavior pattern analysis
- Command usage optimization and recommendations
- Cross-category integration improvements
- System architecture evolution guidance
- Performance bottleneck identification and resolution
