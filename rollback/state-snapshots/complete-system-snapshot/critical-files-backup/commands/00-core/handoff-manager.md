# /handoff-manager - Agent and Session Transition Management

## Purpose

Orchestrate seamless transitions between agents, sessions, and workflow phases by managing state transfer, context preservation, and continuity protocols to ensure zero-loss handoffs and maintain system coherence across all ce-simple operations.

## Principles and Guidelines

- **Seamless Continuity**: Preserve complete context, state, and progress across all transitions without information loss
- **Intelligent State Transfer**: Automatically package and transfer relevant context, decisions, and intermediate results
- **Protocol Enforcement**: Ensure all handoffs follow established protocols with proper validation and confirmation
- **Recovery Capability**: Provide rollback and recovery mechanisms for failed or incomplete transitions

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Handoff Protocol Design
Use TodoWrite to establish comprehensive handoff protocols and state packaging standards. Define transition types (agent-to-agent, session-to-session, phase-to-phase) and create specific procedures for each. Implement validation checkpoints and confirmation mechanisms.

### Phase 2: State Management System
Build intelligent state capture and transfer mechanisms. Create context packaging algorithms that preserve essential information while optimizing transfer efficiency. Implement state validation and integrity checking for reliable handoffs.

### Phase 3: Transition Orchestration
Establish automated transition triggers and coordination protocols. Implement handoff queuing, scheduling, and execution management. Create conflict resolution and priority handling for concurrent transitions.

### Phase 4: Recovery and Monitoring
Implement comprehensive handoff monitoring, logging, and analytics. Create recovery protocols for failed transitions and state reconstruction capabilities. Establish handoff performance metrics and continuous improvement feedback loops.
