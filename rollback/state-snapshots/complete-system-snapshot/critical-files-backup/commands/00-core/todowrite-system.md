# TodoWrite System - Core Behavioral Framework

## Purpose
Behavioral reinforcement system providing automatic validation, progressive workflow tracking, and complete transparency across all command execution.

## Core Architecture

### Intelligent Memory System
TodoWrite reinforces four essential components:
- **Structural validations** (mandatory for system integrity)
- **Context evaluations** (required for execution accuracy)  
- **Workflow decisions** (necessary for optimal orchestration)
- **Progress transparency** (user-facing status communication)

### Automatic Trigger Framework
Context analysis generates todos dynamically:
- **Complex task**: Deploy parallel agents with cognitive load monitoring
- **Simple task**: Execute sequential workflow with validation checkpoints
- **Insufficient context**: Request clarification through dynamic questioning
- **Quality issues**: Apply correction protocol with urgent priority

## Standard Implementation Patterns

### Universal Integration Template
```markdown
## TodoWrite Integration Pattern

Update TodoWrite at key execution points:
1. **Command Start**: Mark primary responsibility as in_progress
2. **Phase Transitions**: Complete current phase, start next with dependencies
3. **Error Handling**: Add error resolution tasks when failures detected
4. **Discovery Integration**: Generate new todos from runtime findings
5. **Command Completion**: Mark all tasks completed, add discovered follow-ups

TodoWrite Format:
- Primary: [main responsibility description with specific scope]
- Validation: [type-specific validation tasks with clear criteria]
- Integration: [orchestration or result processing requirements]
- Follow-up: [any discovered next steps or optimization opportunities]
```

### Context-Driven Generation Framework
**Intelligent Expansion** based on runtime discoveries:
- **Structural issues**: Urgent priority with immediate correction protocol
- **Performance optimization**: Medium priority with efficiency improvements
- **Learning opportunities**: Low priority with pattern capture integration
- **User clarification**: High priority with dynamic questioning deployment

### Quality Assurance Integration
**Standard Templates** for consistency:
- **Structure**: Verify directories, validate file organization
- **References**: Check cross-reference integrity, repair broken links
- **Compliance**: Validate size/format requirements, apply standards
- **Auto-correct**: Fix structural violations with automated repair

## Command-Specific Integration

### Discovery Commands (`/start`, `/enhanced-start`)
```markdown
TodoWrite Pattern:
- Phase-0 assessment with complexity scoring
- Threshold verification with confidence calculation
- Orchestration deployment with agent coordination
- Failure prevention with recovery strategies
```

### Analysis Commands (`/explore-codebase`, `/think-layers`)
```markdown
TodoWrite Pattern:  
- Size assessment with parallel deployment optimization
- Anti-bias protocols with validation checkpoints
- Depth analysis with progressive escalation
- Quality thresholds with health monitoring
```

### Maintenance Commands (`/matrix-maintenance`, `/command-maintain`)
```markdown
TodoWrite Pattern:
- Health assessment with comprehensive scanning
- Threshold application with automated repair
- Recursive optimization with performance monitoring
- Integration validation with cross-reference checking
```

## Progressive Workflow Protocol

### Real-Time Execution
1. **Start Todo**: Mark `in_progress` when beginning operation
2. **Complete Todo**: Mark `completed` immediately after successful completion
3. **Add Discovered**: Generate new todos from runtime discoveries and insights
4. **User Transparency**: All changes visible for progress tracking and confidence

### Dynamic Adaptation
**Context-Sensitive Generation**:
- Monitor execution complexity and adjust orchestration strategy
- Detect quality deviations and trigger correction protocols  
- Identify learning opportunities and capture valuable patterns
- Recognize user confusion and deploy clarification workflows

## Behavioral Consistency Standards

### Command Requirements Checklist
- [ ] **Initialization**: TodoWrite deployment at command start
- [ ] **Context Adaptation**: Dynamic todos generated from execution patterns
- [ ] **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates with clear milestones
- [ ] **Discovery Integration**: New todos created from runtime findings
- [ ] **User Transparency**: Visible progress monitoring throughout execution

### Quality Enforcement
- **Consistency**: Standardized todo patterns across all command types
- **Behavioral Reinforcement**: Zero missed validations through automatic triggers
- **Progress Visibility**: Clear current status with completion confidence metrics
- **Cognitive Load Optimization**: Maintain 3-7 todos for optimal density

## Integration Examples

### Mathematical Commands
```markdown
TodoWrite updates for calculation-heavy operations:
- Validate input parameters with type and range checking
