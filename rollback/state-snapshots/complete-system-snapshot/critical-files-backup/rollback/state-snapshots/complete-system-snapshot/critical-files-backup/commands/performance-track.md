# Performance Track - Analysis Command

## Purpose
Agent performance metrics collection and optimization analysis. Analyzes execution efficiency, identifies optimization opportunities, and generates performance improvement recommendations.

## Principles and Guidelines

**Single Responsibility**: Focus exclusively on performance analysis without coordination
**Granular Metrics**: Collect specific, measurable performance indicators
**Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns and optimization opportunities over time
**Actionable Insights**: Generate specific, implementable performance recommendations

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Performance Data Collection
Update TodoWrite: Mark "Performance data collection" as in_progress

Collect agent performance data:
- Gather execution time metrics from active agents
- Record resource utilization patterns
- Document response time measurements
- Collect throughput and completion statistics

Use Read tool to analyze existing performance logs:
- Read agent execution logs for timing data
- Extract performance metrics from system outputs
- Identify performance trend patterns
- Validate data completeness and accuracy

### Phase 2: Efficiency Analysis
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Performance efficiency analysis" as in_progress

Analyze execution efficiency metrics:
- Calculate average execution times per agent type
- Assess resource utilization effectiveness
- Identify performance bottlenecks and constraints
- Compare performance against baseline expectations

Generate efficiency assessment:
- Document performance strengths and weaknesses
- Identify top-performing and underperforming agents
- Calculate efficiency ratios and utilization rates
- Map performance variations to workload characteristics

### Phase 3: Optimization Identification
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Optimization opportunity identification" as in_progress

Identify optimization opportunities:
- Analyze performance gaps and improvement potential
- Identify resource allocation inefficiencies
- Detect coordination overhead and delays
- Assess scalability limitations and constraints

Generate optimization recommendations:
- Specify concrete performance improvement actions
- Prioritize optimization opportunities by impact
- Estimate improvement potential for each recommendation
- Document implementation requirements for optimizations

### Phase 4: Performance Reporting
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Performance report generation" as in_progress

Generate performance improvement recommendations:
- Create detailed performance analysis report
- Document specific optimization strategies
- Provide implementation guidance for improvements
- Generate performance monitoring recommendations

Use Write tool to create performance report:
- Write comprehensive performance analysis to documentation
- Include specific metrics and trend analysis
- Document optimization recommendations with priorities
- Provide actionable next steps for performance improvement

If performance issues detected:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Address performance issue: [specific problem]"
- Document recommended solution approach
- Specify validation criteria for improvement
- Plan follow-up performance measurement

Update TodoWrite: Complete all performance tracking tasks
Add follow-up: "Performance analysis ready for optimization implementation"
