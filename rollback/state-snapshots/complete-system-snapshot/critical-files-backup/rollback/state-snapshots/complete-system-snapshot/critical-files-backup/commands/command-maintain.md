# Command-Maintain - Automated Command System Maintenance

## Purpose
Comprehensive automated command maintenance system with proactive guardrails, standards enforcement, workflow efficiency optimization, and validation protocols.

## Principles and Guidelines
• **Standards Enforcement**: Validate 150-line limits, execution layer requirements, and template compliance with automated repair
• **Proactive Guardrails**: Real-time enforcement of complexity scores, size limits, and anti-bias rule compliance
• **Documentation Theater Detection**: Identify missing execution layers and ensure 3:1 tool-to-documentation ratio
• **Workflow Optimization**: Batch operations, parallel execution, smart defaults, and comprehensive progress tracking

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Audit and Analysis
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "🔍 AUDIT: Systematic analysis of all commands against documented standards", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "maintain-audit-1"},
  {"content": "📊 ANALYZE: Complexity scoring, size violations, execution deficit detection", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "maintain-analyze-1"}
])
```

**Standards Compliance Audit**:
- Verify 150-line limits and identify size violations
- Apply complexity scoring matrix with 7.0 threshold validation
- Detect documentation theater through execution layer analysis
- Validate template compliance and structural requirements

### Phase 2: Repair and Optimization
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "🔧 REPAIR: Automated fixes for standard violations and compliance issues", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "maintain-repair-1"},
  {"content": "⚙️ OPTIMIZE: File size reduction and execution layer implementation", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "maintain-optimize-1"}
])
```

**Automated Repair Framework**:
- Fix file size violations through progressive disclosure extraction
- Add missing execution layers with tool call implementations
- Repair broken cross-references and update documentation links
- Implement anti-bias compliance measures and template corrections

### Phase 3: Validation and Reporting
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "✅ VALIDATE: Comprehensive verification of maintenance improvements", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "maintain-validate-1"},
  {"content": "📋 REPORT: Generate maintenance summary and compliance status", "status": "pending", "priority": "low", "id": "maintain-report-1"}
])
```

**Comprehensive Validation**:
- Verify all repairs completed successfully with quality metrics
- Generate maintenance summary with compliance improvement scores
- Integrate with matrix-maintenance for system-wide validation
- Execute git commit with detailed maintenance metrics

### Tool Execution Implementation
```javascript
// EXECUTION MODES: audit, repair, optimize, full
const mode = process.argv[2] || 'full'

// AUDIT PHASE (4 operations)
LS("commands") // List command files
Bash("find commands -name '*.md' -exec wc -l {} + | sort -nr") // Size audit
Grep("EXECUTION LAYER", {glob: "commands/*.md", output_mode: "count"}) // Theater detection
Bash("wc -l commands/*.md | awk '{if($1>150) print $2, $1}'") // Violations

// REPAIR PHASE (variable based on violations)
if (mode === 'repair' || mode === 'full') {
  Edit("[oversized-command].md", "[progressive-disclosure-content]") // Size reduction
  Edit("[theater-command].md", "[execution-layer-content]") // Add tool calls
}

// OPTIMIZE PHASE (advanced optimization)
if (mode === 'optimize' || mode === 'full') {
  Task("Guardrail Implementation", "Add real-time enforcement mechanisms")
  Task("Complexity Validation", "Apply scoring matrix with threshold enforcement")
}

// REPORTING & INTEGRATION (3 operations)
Bash("echo 'MAINTENANCE REPORT: Commands:' $(ls commands/*.md | wc -l) 'Violations:' $(wc -l commands/*.md | awk '$1>150' | wc -l)") // Metrics
Task("Matrix Maintenance", "Execute /matrix-maintenance for system validation")
Bash("git add . && git commit -m \"command-maintain: compliance: [X]% | violations-fixed: [N] ✓maintenance\"")
```
