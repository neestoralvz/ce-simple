# /context-engine - Automated Context Management

## Purpose

Provide intelligent, automated context updating and synchronization across the distributed ce-simple memory architecture to maintain system coherence, optimize performance, and ensure accurate cross-referencing throughout all documentation and commands.

## Principles and Guidelines

- **Intelligent Automation**: Automatically detect context changes and update relevant documentation without manual intervention
- **Distributed Coherence**: Maintain consistency across all context files, cross-references, and system documentation
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimize context overhead while maximizing accuracy and relevance of system memory
- **Adaptive Learning**: Learn from usage patterns to improve context relevance and update frequency

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Context Detection System
Use TodoWrite to establish context change detection mechanisms. Implement file monitoring, git change tracking, and command execution analysis. Create context dependency mapping to identify update cascades and cross-reference impacts.

### Phase 2: Automated Update Engine
Build automated update mechanisms for context files, documentation cross-references, and system metadata. Implement intelligent batching and conflict resolution. Create update validation and rollback capabilities for system safety.

### Phase 3: Synchronization Protocols
Establish real-time synchronization between distributed context elements. Implement context consolidation algorithms and redundancy elimination. Create context health monitoring and integrity verification systems.

### Phase 4: Learning and Optimization
Implement context usage analytics and pattern recognition. Create adaptive algorithms for context prioritization and update scheduling. Establish performance metrics and continuous optimization feedback loops.
