# Analyze Parallel Implementation - Execution Optimization Engine

## Purpose
Comprehensive analysis of task plans for optimal parallel execution opportunities with aggressive optimization recommendations and performance projections.

## Principles and Guidelines
- **Batch Operations Analysis**: Identify tasks for simultaneous execution without conflicts through dependency mapping
- **Risk Assessment**: Parallel execution safety evaluation with mitigation strategies and failure recovery protocols
- **Resource Optimization**: Maximize tool call efficiency and minimize execution time through intelligent allocation
- **Performance Projection**: Calculate precise timing estimates for parallel vs sequential execution with 5-15x speed targets

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Plan Discovery and Task Structure Analysis

  {"content": "Analyze task structure with dependency mapping and resource conflict detection", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "parallel-structure-1"},
  {"content": "Parse task lists into structured format with explicit dependency identification", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "parallel-parse-1"}
])
```

### Phase 2: Parallelization Analysis and Batch Classification
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "Build directed acyclic graph (DAG) of task relationships", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "parallel-dag-1"},
  {"content": "Classify tasks: Class A (immediate parallel), Class B (sequential dependencies), Class C (resource conflicts), Class D (checkpoint dependencies)", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "parallel-classify-1"},
  {"content": "Group independent tasks into parallel batches with optimal sizing", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "parallel-batch-1"}
])
```

### Phase 3: Performance Analysis and Optimization Strategy
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "Calculate parallel execution timing estimates with critical path analysis", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "parallel-timing-1"},
  {"content": "Generate optimization strategies: aggressive (8-16 operations), conservative (4-8 operations), hybrid approach", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "parallel-strategy-1"},
  {"content": "Assess resource utilization and coordination overhead", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "parallel-resource-1"}
])
```

### Phase 4: Risk Assessment and Recommendations
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "Evaluate safety of parallel execution with conflict detection matrix", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "parallel-safety-1"},
  {"content": "Generate detailed batch recommendations with execution phases", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "parallel-recommend-1"},
  {"content": "Create mitigation strategies for identified risks and recovery protocols", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "parallel-mitigate-1"}
])
```

## Batch Classification Framework

### Execution Classes
**Class A - Immediate Parallel (No Dependencies)**:
- File discovery operations (Glob patterns) - 90%+ tasks eligible
- Independent analysis tasks (Grep searches)
- Read-only validation operations
- Documentation generation tasks

**Class B - Sequential Dependencies (Ordered)**:
- File creation → content population - 15-25% require specific ordering
- Directory creation → file placement
- Validation → correction → re-validation

**Class C - Resource Conflicts (Exclusive)**:
- Concurrent file modifications - 5-10% require exclusive access
- Database transaction operations
- System configuration changes

**Class D - Checkpoint Dependencies (Gated)**:
- Validation-dependent operations - 10-20% require checkpoint completion
- Quality gate requirements
- Approval-required changes

## Optimization Strategy Framework

### Performance Targets
**Aggressive Batching**: 8-16 parallel operations per phase, 85-95% resource utilization, 5-15x speed improvement
**Conservative Parallel**: 4-8 parallel operations per phase, 70-85% resource utilization, 3-8x speed improvement
**Hybrid Approach**: Class A maximum parallelization (16+ concurrent), Class B sequential with parallel prep

### Success Metrics
**Performance Standards**:
- 5-15x speed improvement for parallelizable tasks
- <5% failure rate with parallel execution
- >90% resource utilization efficiency
- <2% overhead for coordination costs

**Quality Assurance**:
- 100% task completion (no lost operations)
- Maintained checkpoint integrity
- Zero data corruption incidents
- >95% user satisfaction with parallel results
