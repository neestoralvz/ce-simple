# Complexity Assess - Mathematical Command

## Purpose
Embedded complexity calculations with 4-decimal precision for agent workload assessment and deployment strategy determination.

## Principles and Guidelines

**Single Responsibility**: Focus exclusively on mathematical calculations without deployment execution
**Granular Calculation**: Break assessment into small, precise calculation steps
**Precision Management**: Clear 4-decimal precision requirements with validation protocols
**Error Recovery**: Built-in calculation error handling and validation protocols

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Parameter Validation
Update TodoWrite: Mark "Complexity calculation parameter validation" as in_progress

Validate input parameters:
- Check workload parameter is numeric and within range (0-10)
- Verify dependencies parameter is numeric and valid (0-10)
- Confirm constraints parameter is numeric and appropriate (0-10)
- Validate all parameters are properly formatted for bc calculation

Prepare calculation environment:
- Set bc scale to 4 for consistent precision
- Initialize calculation variables
- Prepare error handling for invalid inputs
- Set up validation checks for boundary conditions

### Phase 2: Complexity Calculation
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Agent complexity calculation" as in_progress

Execute complexity calculation using embedded formula:

Use Bash for complexity assessment:
```bash
# Agent workload complexity assessment with 4-decimal precision
complexity=$(echo "scale=4; ($workload + $dependencies + $constraints) / 3" | bc)
```

Validate calculation results:
- Verify complexity score has 4-decimal precision
- Check result is within expected range (0.0000-10.0000)
- Confirm calculation accuracy with test cases
- Document calculation process and intermediate steps

### Phase 3: Strategy Determination
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Deployment strategy determination" as in_progress

Determine deployment strategy based on complexity:

Use Bash for strategy decision:
```bash
if (( $(echo "$complexity >= 7.0000" | bc -l) )); then
    strategy="high-parallel"
elif (( $(echo "$complexity >= 4.0000" | bc -l) )); then
    strategy="parallel"
elif (( $(echo "$complexity >= 2.0000" | bc -l) )); then
    strategy="sequential"
else
    strategy="single-agent"
fi
```

Validate strategy determination:
- Verify threshold boundaries are correctly applied
- Check strategy matches complexity score range
- Confirm threshold logic is properly implemented
- Test edge cases at boundary values

### Phase 4: Result Validation and Reporting
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Calculation result validation" as in_progress

Validate final results:
- Verify 4-decimal precision in complexity score
- Confirm strategy recommendation matches score
- Check threshold classification is accurate
- Validate all calculations are consistent

Generate standardized assessment report:
- Format complexity score with 4-decimal precision
- Document strategy recommendation with rationale
- Record threshold classification and boundaries
- Report calculation validation status

If calculation errors occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve calculation error: [specific issue]"
- Implement fallback calculation with safe defaults
- Validate error recovery before proceeding
- Document error resolution for future reference

Update TodoWrite: Complete all calculation tasks
Add follow-up: "Complexity assessment ready for deployment coordination"
