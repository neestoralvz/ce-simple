# Think Layers - Analysis Command

## Purpose
Execute progressive cognitive analysis through layered thinking approach: L1 Think → L2 Think-Hard → L3 Think-Harder → L4 Ultra-Think for comprehensive problem analysis.

## Principles and Guidelines

**Single Responsibility**: Focus exclusively on progressive analysis without implementation or coordination
**Granular Analysis**: Break layered thinking into small, specific analysis steps
**Depth Management**: Clear layer progression with explicit escalation requirements
**Error Recovery**: Built-in analysis failure handling and layer adjustment protocols

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Analysis Depth Assessment and Layer Planning
Update TodoWrite: Mark "Analysis depth assessment" as in_progress

Assess analysis complexity and required depth:
- Evaluate problem complexity using embedded assessment
- Determine required thinking layer depth (L1-L4)
- Calculate cognitive load requirements for analysis
- Plan layer progression and escalation criteria

Prepare progressive analysis framework:
- Set baseline analysis parameters and constraints
- Define escalation triggers for deeper analysis
- Establish quality validation criteria for each layer
- Plan synthesis approach for multi-layer integration

### Phase 2: Layer 1 - Basic Pattern Analysis
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Layer 1 analysis execution" as in_progress

Execute Layer 1 thinking (25% cognitive load):
- Identify surface patterns and basic understanding
- Document initial observations and obvious relationships
- Establish foundation context for deeper analysis
- Validate L1 completeness before progression

Assess Layer 1 results:
- Evaluate analysis completeness and quality
- Determine if additional depth required
- Apply escalation criteria for Layer 2 progression
- Document L1 insights for synthesis integration

### Phase 3: Progressive Layer Execution (L2-L4)
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Progressive layer analysis" as in_progress

Execute Layer 2 thinking (50% cognitive load) if required:
- Analyze component relationships and interactions
- Map system connections and dependencies
- Develop intermediate understanding and insights
- Validate L2 completion and escalation needs

Execute Layer 3 thinking (75% cognitive load) if complex:
- Integrate systems analysis and strategic thinking
- Develop comprehensive understanding frameworks
- Generate strategic insights and approaches
- Assess need for maximum depth analysis

Execute Layer 4 thinking (95% cognitive load) if maximum complexity:
- Apply meta-analysis and innovative thinking
- Generate novel insights and breakthrough approaches
- Develop comprehensive solution frameworks
- Complete maximum depth cognitive analysis

### Phase 4: Analysis Synthesis and Consolidation
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Analysis synthesis" as in_progress

Synthesize insights across all executed layers:
- Consolidate findings from L1 through executed layers
- Resolve contradictions and integrate perspectives
- Generate comprehensive analysis summary
- Validate synthesis quality and completeness

Generate analysis conclusions and recommendations:
- Document key insights and breakthrough discoveries
- Create actionable analysis conclusions
- Generate implementation recommendations
- Provide strategic guidance based on layered analysis

Use Write tool to document layered analysis:
- Create comprehensive progressive analysis report
- Document layer-by-layer insights and progression
- Include synthesis conclusions and recommendations
- Generate strategic analysis summary

If layer analysis issues detected:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve analysis issue: [specific layer/problem]"
- Re-execute problematic analysis layer with adjustments
- Validate layer quality before proceeding to synthesis
- Document resolution approach for methodology improvement

Update TodoWrite: Complete all layered analysis tasks
Add follow-up: "Progressive analysis complete with comprehensive insights ready"
