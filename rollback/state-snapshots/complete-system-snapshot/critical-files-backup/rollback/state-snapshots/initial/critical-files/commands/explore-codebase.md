# Explore Codebase - Exploration Command

## Purpose
Systematically explore internal codebase structure and patterns using parallel operations for comprehensive architectural analysis and pattern discovery.

## Principles and Guidelines

**Single Responsibility**: Focus exclusively on internal codebase exploration without external research or implementation
**Granular Exploration**: Break codebase analysis into small, specific exploration steps
**Pattern Management**: Clear discovery protocols with explicit validation requirements
**Error Recovery**: Built-in exploration failure handling and re-analysis protocols

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Codebase Structure Assessment
Update TodoWrite: Mark "Codebase structure assessment" as in_progress

Assess codebase size and complexity:
- Use LS tool to analyze directory structure and organization
- Count total files and directories for complexity assessment
- Identify primary architecture patterns and organization
- Determine optimal exploration strategy based on codebase size

Calculate exploration complexity and scope:
- Analyze project structure depth and breadth
- Assess file organization patterns and conventions
- Determine parallelization requirements for efficiency
- Plan exploration operation count based on complexity

Validate codebase accessibility:
- Verify all directories are accessible for exploration
- Check file permissions and exploration constraints
- Confirm no exploration blockers or limitations
- Prepare baseline for systematic exploration

### Phase 2: Parallel Architecture Discovery
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Architecture pattern discovery" as in_progress

Execute parallel architectural analysis:
- Use Glob tool for file type and structure pattern discovery
- Use Glob to identify configuration files and build systems
- Use Glob to map directory organization and naming conventions
- Use Glob to discover documentation and specification patterns

Analyze architectural patterns concurrently:
- Identify framework usage and integration patterns
- Map component relationships and dependencies
- Discover architectural decisions and design patterns
- Document organizational conventions and standards

### Phase 3: Code Pattern and Content Analysis
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Code pattern analysis" as in_progress

Execute comprehensive content analysis:
- Use Grep tool for function and class pattern discovery
- Use Grep to identify import patterns and dependencies
- Use Grep to discover API usage and integration points
- Use Grep to analyze error handling and logging patterns

Extract implementation patterns:
- Identify coding conventions and style patterns
- Map function signatures and interface patterns
- Discover testing approaches and coverage patterns
- Analyze configuration and environment patterns

### Phase 4: Documentation and Configuration Review
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Documentation and configuration review" as in_progress

Review critical system documentation:
- Use Read tool for configuration file analysis
- Use Read tool for documentation review and extraction
- Use Read tool for build system and environment analysis
- Use Read tool for specification and requirement review

Synthesize exploration findings:
- Consolidate architectural discoveries and patterns
- Generate comprehensive codebase analysis report
- Document discovered patterns and conventions
- Identify potential improvements and recommendations

Use Write tool to document exploration results:
- Create detailed codebase exploration report
- Document architectural patterns and organization
- Record discovered conventions and best practices
- Generate recommendations for codebase improvement

If exploration gaps detected:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Address exploration gap: [specific area]"
- Re-execute exploration with enhanced scope and depth
- Validate completeness before final consolidation
- Document lessons learned for future explorations

Update TodoWrite: Complete all codebase exploration tasks
Add follow-up: "Codebase exploration complete with comprehensive analysis ready"
