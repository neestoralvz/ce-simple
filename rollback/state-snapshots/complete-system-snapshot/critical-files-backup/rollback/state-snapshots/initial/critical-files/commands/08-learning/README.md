# 08-learning - Learning & Pattern Commands

## Purpose
Continuous learning and pattern extraction system. These commands capture insights, identify patterns, and evolve system capabilities through intelligent analysis of successes, failures, and optimization opportunities.

## Commands
- `/capture-learnings` - Pattern extraction and documentation
- `/pattern-analyze` - Pattern analysis and classification
- `/success-study` - Success factor analysis and replication
- `/failure-analyze` - Failure analysis and prevention strategies
- `/evolution-guide` - System evolution and improvement guidance

## Category Relations
- **Fed by**: All categories for learning input
- **Feeds into**: 00-core for system improvements
- **Coordinates with**: 06-documentation for knowledge capture
- **Uses**: 12-math for pattern quantification

## Usage Patterns
```
All-categories → 08-learning/capture → 00-core/evolve
08-learning/patterns → 06-documentation/extract → 01-discovery/context
08-learning/analyze → 07-maintenance/optimize → 05-validation/improve
```

## Learning Domains
- **Execution Patterns**: Successful implementation strategies
- **Problem Patterns**: Common issues and solution approaches
- **Performance Patterns**: Optimization techniques and bottlenecks
- **User Patterns**: Interaction preferences and workflow optimization

## Pattern Types
- **Success Patterns**: Proven approaches and best practices
- **Anti-Patterns**: Common mistakes and avoidance strategies
- **Optimization Patterns**: Performance and efficiency improvements
- **Integration Patterns**: Cross-system coordination and compatibility

## Learning Outputs
- Pattern libraries with usage guidelines
- Success/failure case studies with lessons learned
- Evolution recommendations for system improvements
- Performance optimization insights and techniques
- User experience enhancements and workflow optimizations
