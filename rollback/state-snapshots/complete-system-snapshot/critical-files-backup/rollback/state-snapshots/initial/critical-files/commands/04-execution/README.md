# 04-execution - Execution & Implementation Commands

## Purpose
Core implementation and execution engine. These commands transform plans into reality through intelligent task orchestration, parallel execution, and real-time adaptation.

## Commands
- `/execute-plan` - Orchestrated plan implementation
- `/parallel-tasks` - Parallel task execution coordination
- `/adaptive-implement` - Dynamic implementation with real-time adjustments
- `/pipeline-execute` - Sequential pipeline execution
- `/rollback-execute` - Safe execution with automatic rollback

## Category Relations
- **Triggered by**: 02-planning, 03-analysis
- **Coordinates with**: 05-validation for quality assurance
- **Uses**: 14-utils for execution utilities
- **Reports to**: 08-learning for pattern capture

## Usage Patterns
```
02-planning/phases → 04-execution/execute → 05-validation/verify
03-analysis/feasibility → 04-execution/parallel → 08-learning/capture
04-execution/adaptive → 05-validation/continuous → 07-maintenance/optimize
```

## Execution Strategies
- **Parallel Execution**: Independent tasks run simultaneously
- **Sequential Pipeline**: Dependent tasks in ordered sequence
- **Adaptive Execution**: Real-time plan adjustments based on results
- **Rollback Safe**: Automatic recovery from failed implementations

## Orchestration Features
- Task dependency resolution and scheduling
- Resource allocation and load balancing
- Progress monitoring and status reporting
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Quality gate integration and validation

## Execution Monitoring
- Real-time progress tracking
- Performance metrics collection
- Error detection and classification
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Success/failure pattern analysis
