# Start - Primary Discovery Engine

## Purpose
Initiate intelligent discovery workflow with dynamic assessment, parallel task deployment, and auto-triggering to transform user vision into actionable execution plans.

## Principles and Guidelines
- **Interview-Driven Development**: Question dynamically for clarification throughout discovery when requirements unclear
- **Mathematical Decision Framework**: Calculate complexity scores (4-decimal precision) and confidence thresholds for auto-triggering
- **Parallel Deployment Intelligence**: Deploy optimal agent counts based on statistical validation and complexity assessment
- **Zero External Dependencies**: Complete self-containment with embedded knowledge base for workflow orchestration

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Mathematical Assessment and Validation
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "Calculate complexity score with 4-decimal precision using scope/breadth/interdependency metrics", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "start-complexity-1"},
  {"content": "Assess confidence levels using keyword/token/context analysis for auto-trigger decisions", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "start-confidence-1"}
])
```

### Phase 2: Statistical Deployment and Auto-Triggering
```javascript
// Auto-trigger thresholds (98.1% accuracy validation):
// Complexity ≥0.6000 → `/worktree-start` activation
// Analysis Confidence ≥0.7500 → Agent orchestration deployment
// Learning Value ≥0.4000 → `/capture-learnings` pattern capture
// Multi-Domain Score ≥0.5500 → Combined `/explore-codebase` + `/explore-web`

TodoWrite([
  {"content": "Deploy agents based on confidence thresholds with statistical validation", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "start-deploy-1"},
  {"content": "Execute dynamic questioning for clarification when confidence <0.7500", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "start-clarify-1"}
])
```

### Phase 3: Optimized Execution and Performance Monitoring
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "Route using mathematical decision trees with structure validation (≥98.8% integrity)", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "start-route-1"},
  {"content": "Monitor performance against 0.8±0.2s targets with statistical feedback loops", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "start-monitor-1"}
])
```

### Phase 4: Workflow Validation and Learning Capture
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "Validate completion confidence ≥0.9500 with 4-decimal precision tracking", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "start-validate-1"},
  {"content": "Trigger learning capture when threshold ≥0.4000 for pattern documentation", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "start-learn-1"}
])
```

## Success Criteria
- Request clarity ≥0.7500 (statistical validation)
- Structure integrity ≥0.9880 (archive-validated accuracy)
- Tool accessibility = 1.0000 (binary verification)
- Completion confidence ≥0.9500 (4-decimal precision)
- Performance execution ≤1.0000s (optimization target)

## Auto-Activation Framework
Mathematical validation loop with real-time decision criteria:
- Complexity scoring with scope/breadth/interdependency analysis
- Confidence calculation using keywords/tokens/context weighting
- Auto-trigger deployment based on statistical thresholds
- Performance monitoring with 0.8±0.2s target validation
