# 00-core - Core System Commands

## Purpose
Fundamental system operations that form the foundation of ce-simple. These commands handle primary entry points, system initialization, and essential orchestration functions.

## Commands
- `/start` - Primary entry point with dynamic questioning
- `/enhanced-start` - Advanced discovery with Phase 0 assessment
- `/system-init` - Initialize new project environments
- `/core-status` - System health and status monitoring
- `/emergency-reset` - System recovery and reset procedures

## Category Relations
- **Triggers**: 01-discovery, 02-planning, 03-analysis
- **Coordinates**: All categories through orchestration
- **Depends on**: 10-standards for compliance validation
- **Monitors**: 08-learning for continuous improvement

## Usage Patterns
```
/start → Dynamic questioning → Task orchestration
/enhanced-start → Phase 0 assessment → Autotrigger execution  
/system-init → Environment setup → Dependency validation
/core-status → Health check → Performance metrics
/emergency-reset → Recovery mode → System restoration
```

## Orchestration Model
Core commands use intelligent task coordination:
- Parallel execution when possible
- Sequential for dependent operations
- Dynamic questioning throughout all phases
- Automatic fallback and recovery mechanisms

## Integration Points
- Entry point for all user interactions
- Central coordination hub for complex workflows
- System integrity validation checkpoint
- Performance and health monitoring center
