# Binary Validation Framework

**Updated**: 2025-07-24 | **Authority**: Anti-Bias Validation System | **Limit**: 80 lines

## Purpose
Eliminate interpretation bias in validation through binary yes/no questions with measurable criteria. Multiple evaluators must reach identical conclusions.

## Core Principle
**Every validation question must be answerable with YES or NO based on objective, countable criteria.**

## UltraThink x4 Validation

### Layer Assessment Questions
- [ ] **Layer 1 Applied**: Did analysis identify specific problem and scope? (YES/NO)
- [ ] **Layer 2 Applied**: Are ≥2 alternative approaches or trade-offs identified? (YES/NO)  
- [ ] **Layer 3 Applied**: Are multi-system impacts and risks assessed? (YES/NO)
- [ ] **Layer 4 Applied**: Is complete implementation roadmap documented? (YES/NO)

## PTS Framework Validation

### Technical Cluster (YES/NO Required)
- [ ] **Directness**: Does solution use ≤3 steps to achieve objective? 
- [ ] **Precision**: Are 100% of paths absolute (no relative references)?
- [ ] **Sufficiency**: Does solution cover 100% of stated requirements?
- [ ] **Technical Excellence**: Does code/implementation have 0 syntax errors?

### Communication Cluster (YES/NO Required)  
- [ ] **Exactitude**: Does output match 100% of specified requirements?
- [ ] **Sobriety**: Is substance-to-fluff ratio ≥95%?
- [ ] **Structure**: Can target be found in ≤30 seconds navigation time?
- [ ] **Conciseness**: Is information density ≥80%?

### Cognitive Cluster (YES/NO Required)
- [ ] **Clarity**: Can new developer understand purpose in ≤5 minutes?
- [ ] **Coherence**: Are there 0 internal contradictions?
- [ ] **Effectiveness**: Does solution achieve stated goal in ≥90% test cases?
- [ ] **Pragmatism**: Does solution work in production with 0 additional configuration?

## TodoWrite Validation

### Trigger Criteria (YES/NO Required)
- [ ] **Multi-Step**: Does task require ≥2 sequential actions?
- [ ] **Multi-Tool**: Does task use >1 Claude Code tool?
- [ ] **Multi-File**: Does task affect >1 file in system?
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Must Task A complete before Task B can start?
- [ ] **User Request**: Did user explicitly mention "todo" or task tracking?

### Status Tracking (YES/NO Required)
- [ ] **Real-Time Updates**: Is task marked in_progress BEFORE starting work?
- [ ] **Immediate Completion**: Is task marked completed within 30 seconds of finishing?
- [ ] **Single Focus**: Is exactly 1 task marked as in_progress?
- [ ] **Discovery Tracking**: Are newly discovered subtasks added within 60 seconds?

## Anti-Bias Language Validation

### Objective Criteria (YES/NO Required)
- [ ] **Measurable Terms**: Can all criteria be counted or timed?
- [ ] **Zero Subjectivity**: Are there 0 terms requiring personal interpretation?
- [ ] **Universal Understanding**: Will ≥95% of readers interpret criteria identically?
- [ ] **Specific Thresholds**: Are all quality gates defined with exact numbers?

## Documentation Standards Validation

### Length and Structure (YES/NO Required)
- [ ] **Line Limit**: Is document ≤100 lines total?
- [ ] **Compaction Applied**: Are pipe headers, arrows, and dense formatting used?
- [ ] **Reference Precision**: Are all cross-references using exact @path/file.md format?
- [ ] **Agent Compliance**: Was specialized writing agent used for creation/editing?

## Binary Decision Framework

### Usage Instructions
1. **Answer each question YES or NO only**
2. **If ANY answer is NO, validation fails**  
3. **If uncertain, answer NO and identify specific criteria needed**
4. **Multiple evaluators must reach identical YES/NO conclusions**

### Blocking Criteria
- **Any NO answer = IMMEDIATE STOP**
- **Proceed only when 100% YES responses achieved**
- **Re-evaluate after corrections until all criteria met**

**Core Principle**: Validation eliminates human interpretation bias through objective, countable, binary assessment criteria.
