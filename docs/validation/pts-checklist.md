**If any test fails ‚Üí STOP ‚Üí Redesign**

### Phase 2: Complete Evaluation (10 minutes)
1. **Execute complete 12-component checklist**
2. **Verify absence of blocking criteria**
3. **Document decisions and trade-offs**
4. **Measure quantitative metrics where applicable**

**If any component fails ‚Üí STOP ‚Üí Document reason ‚Üí Redesign**

### Phase 3: Contextual Validation (5 minutes)
1. **Verify fit with tier 1-5 principles**
2. **Confirm alignment with docs/vision/**
3. **Validate consistency with existing system**
4. **Impact on maintainability assessment**

**If contextual validation fails ‚Üí STOP ‚Üí Evaluate systemic impact**

## üõ†Ô∏è Validation Tools and Procedures

### Quick STP Analysis Tool
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# stp-quick-check.sh [file]

echo "=== STP Quick Check ==="
FILE=$1

# Directness Check
STEPS=$(grep -c "^###\|^Step\|^Phase" "$FILE")
echo "Execution steps: $STEPS (target: ‚â§3)"

# Precision Check  
REL_PATHS=$(grep -c "\.\.\/" "$FILE")
ABS_PATHS=$(grep -c "^/" "$FILE" || grep -c "/Users" "$FILE")
echo "Relative paths: $REL_PATHS (target: 0)"
echo "Absolute paths: $ABS_PATHS (target: >0)"

# Sufficiency Check
EXTERNAL_REFS=$(grep -c "see\|refer\|check" "$FILE")
echo "External references: $EXTERNAL_REFS (review for self-containment)"

# Structure Check
STANDARD_SECTIONS=$(grep -c "^## Purpose\|^## Principles\|^## Execution" "$FILE")
echo "Standard sections: $STANDARD_SECTIONS (target: 3)"

# Clarity Check
WORD_COUNT=$(wc -w < "$FILE")
LINE_COUNT=$(wc -l < "$FILE")
DENSITY=$((WORD_COUNT / LINE_COUNT))
echo "Information density: $DENSITY words/line (target: >8)"

echo "=== Review Required If Any Metric Fails ==="
```

### Detailed Component Validation

#### 1. Directness Validation
**Test Process**:
```bash
# Count execution steps from user input to first output
time [command] | wc -l  # Should be ‚â§ 3 major steps
```

**Validation Questions**:
- Can user achieve objective in single command?
- Are there unnecessary intermediate abstractions?
- Is the path from intent to implementation linear?

**Quantitative Threshold**: ‚â§ 3 execution steps

#### 2. Precision Validation
**Test Process**:
```bash
# Check for absolute paths
grep -r "\.\./" [file] && echo "FAIL: Relative paths found"
grep -r "^/" [file] && echo "PASS: Absolute paths used"

# Check error message specificity
grep -r "error\|fail" [file] | grep -v "specific" && echo "Review error messages"
```

**Validation Questions**:
- Are all file paths absolute?
- Do error messages provide specific resolution steps?
- Are all dependencies explicitly versioned?

**Quantitative Threshold**: 100% absolute paths, 100% specific error messages

#### 3. Sufficiency Validation
**Test Process**:
```bash
# Test from clean environment
rm -rf test-project
mkdir test-project
cd test-project
# Execute command following documentation exactly
[command] && echo "PASS: Complete self-containment"
```

**Validation Questions**:
- Can new user succeed following documentation alone?
- Are all required components included?
- Does command execute without external dependencies?

**Quantitative Threshold**: 100% success rate for documented usage

#### 4. Technical Excellence Validation
**Test Process**:
```bash
# Code quality analysis (conceptual - adapt to actual tools)
complexity-analyzer [file] --threshold 15
quality-checker [file] --min-score 90
```

**Validation Questions**:
- Does code follow SOLID principles?
- Is architecture appropriately complex (not over/under)?
- Are patterns used correctly?

**Quantitative Threshold**: ‚â• 90% quality score, ‚â§ 15 cyclomatic complexity

## üîß Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-Commit STP Validation
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit-stp

echo "Running STP validation..."

for file in $(git diff --cached --name-only | grep "\.md$"); do
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        echo "Validating: $file"
        
        # Quick STP checks
        STEPS=$(grep -c "^Phase\|^Step" "$file")
        REL_PATHS=$(grep -c "\.\.\/" "$file")
        MARKETING=$(grep -ci "amazing\|incredible\|revolutionary" "$file")
        
        if [ $STEPS -gt 3 ] || [ $REL_PATHS -gt 0 ] || [ $MARKETING -gt 0 ]; then
            echo "‚ùå STP validation failed for: $file"
            echo "   Steps: $STEPS (max: 3)"
            echo "   Relative paths: $REL_PATHS (max: 0)"
            echo "   Marketing language: $MARKETING (max: 0)"
            echo
            echo "Please fix STP issues before committing."
            exit 1
        fi
    fi
done

echo "‚úÖ All files pass STP validation"
```

### Application Order
1. **PTS Tier 0** - Mandatory primary filter
2. **Tier 1-5 Principles** - Applied only if passes PTS
3. **Specific context** - Final validation

### Development Flow
```yaml
Idea/Requirement:
  -> PTS Pre-evaluation (2 min)
  -> If passes: PTS Complete Evaluation (10 min)  
  -> If passes: PTS Contextual Validation (5 min)
  -> If passes: Apply Tier 1-5 principles
  -> Implement
```

## üîó Integration with Existing Principles

### PTS modifies SOLID application:
- **SRP + PTS**: One clear responsibility AND pragmatically useful
- **OCP + PTS**: Extensible in simple and evident way
- **LSP + PTS**: Substitution without additional complexity
- **ISP + PTS**: Specific interfaces AND easy to use
- **DIP + PTS**: Pragmatic abstractions, not theoretical

### PTS modifies other principles:
- **DRY + PTS**: Don't repeat knowledge, with pragmatism - if eliminating duplication adds significant complexity, evaluate trade-off
- **YAGNI + PTS**: Don't implement until pragmatically valuable - need must be evident and immediate, not speculative

### Conflict Resolution Protocol
**When PTS components conflict with each other:**

1. **Priority Order**:
   1. Effectiveness (must solve real problems)
   2. Directness (must be simplest path)
   3. Precision (must be exact and correct)
   4. Clarity (must be understandable)

2. **Resolution Process**:
   - Identify specific conflict points
   - Apply priority order to determine winner
   - Seek solution that satisfies both when possible
   - Document resolution rationale

## üìà Validation Examples

### Before/After STP Application

#### Example 1: Command Description
**Before (Non-STP)**:
```markdown
# awesome-command
This amazing command revolutionizes your workflow by providing incredible automation capabilities that will transform how you develop software.
```

**After (STP Applied)**:
```markdown  
# init-project
Executes complete ce-simple project initialization through automated git setup providing functional development foundation.
```

**STP Components Applied**:
- ‚úÖ **Sobriety**: Removed marketing language
- ‚úÖ **Precision**: Specific functionality described
- ‚úÖ **Conciseness**: Maximum information density
- ‚úÖ **Exactitude**: Verifiable behavior claim

#### Example 2: Error Handling
**Before (Non-STP)**:
```markdown
If something goes wrong, try to fix it and run again.
```

**After (STP Applied)**:
```markdown
If git initialization failures occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve git error: permission verification"
- Execute fallback: create project structure without git
- Provide manual git setup: run `git init && git config user.name 'Your Name'`
```

**STP Components Applied**:
- ‚úÖ **Precision**: Specific error conditions and solutions
- ‚úÖ **Directness**: Clear resolution path
- ‚úÖ **Sufficiency**: Complete recovery information
- ‚úÖ **Effectiveness**: Actionable solutions

---

## üéØ Binary Validation Protocol

**Authority**: All 12 PTS components must achieve binary pass/fail validation

**Implementation Standard**:
- **12/12 Compliance Required**: All components must pass validation
- **Blocking Standard**: Non-compliance prevents implementation
- **Assessment**: Binary pass/fail per component
- **Quality Gate**: PTS validation required for all system additions

**PTS Mantra**: *"‚â§3 steps, measurable accuracy, technical quality ‚â•90%, production success ‚â•95% - no exceptions."*

---

**Fundamental Principle**: PTS is the mandatory filter that ensures we only develop solutions that are simultaneously simple, technically sound, and pragmatically valuable.

**Application**: Every system element must pass PTS before any other consideration - it's the foundation that enables architectural excellence without over-engineering.
