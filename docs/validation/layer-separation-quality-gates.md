- [ ] **Decision Triggers**: When to apply + context + success criteria clearly defined
- [ ] **Implementation Reference**: Proper link to implementation file
- [ ] **Validation Reference**: Agent deployment footer present

### Content Requirements
- [ ] **Essential Only**: Only essential understanding included
- [ ] **No Procedures**: No step-by-step procedures included
- [ ] **No Technical Details**: No code, configuration, or tool instructions
- [ ] **Key Concepts**: 3-5 concepts maximum, 1 line each
- [ ] **Integration Points**: How methodology connects with system
- [ ] **Quick Reference**: Links to templates and resources

### Quality Standards
- [ ] **Cognitive Load**: Can be understood in <5 minutes
- [ ] **Decision Support**: Provides clear guidance on when/how to apply
- [ ] **Self-Contained**: Core understanding complete without additional files
- [ ] **Agent Integration**: Footer properly references implementation and validation

## Implementation Layer Validation

### Structure Requirements
- [ ] **Prerequisites Section**: Required setup + dependencies clearly defined
- [ ] **Core Process Section**: Step-by-step workflow documented

- [ ] **Troubleshooting Section**: Common issues + solutions included
- [ ] **Tools Section**: Specific tool usage + platform requirements

### Content Requirements
- [ ] **Complete Coverage**: All implementation aspects covered
- [ ] **Step-by-Step**: Clear procedural guidance provided
- [ ] **Technical Specifications**: Code examples + configuration included
- [ ] **Decision Points**: Alternative paths and choices documented
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Recovery procedures for common failures

### Quality Standards
- [ ] **Actionable**: Can be executed by following instructions
- [ ] **Complete**: No gaps in procedure coverage
- [ ] **Testable**: Procedures can be validated through execution
- [ ] **Reference Integration**: Links back to concept and forward to validation

## Verification Layer Validation

### Structure Requirements
- [ ] **Pre-Validation Checklist**: Requirements check before implementation
- [ ] **Process Quality Gates**: Quality checks during methodology application
- [ ] **Post-Validation Criteria**: Completion verification requirements
- [ ] **Compliance Standards**: Framework adherence requirements
- [ ] **Success Metrics**: Quantitative and qualitative measures
- [ ] **Failure Recovery**: Actions when validation fails

### Content Requirements
- [ ] **Measurable Criteria**: All validation points objectively measurable
- [ ] **Clear Pass/Fail**: Binary determination criteria for each check
- [ ] **Comprehensive Coverage**: All quality aspects addressed
- [ ] **Authority References**: Links to governing standards and frameworks
- [ ] **Recovery Procedures**: Clear actions for validation failures

### Quality Standards
- [ ] **Objective**: No subjective assessment criteria
- [ ] **Actionable**: Clear actions for each validation point
- [ ] **Complete**: Covers all quality dimensions
- [ ] **Authority-Based**: References authoritative standards

## Cross-Layer Integration Validation

### Reference Integrity
- [ ] **Concept → Implementation**: Proper reference links functional
- [ ] **Concept → Verification**: Agent deployment footer complete
- [ ] **Implementation → Verification**: Quality gate references throughout
- [ ] **Circular References**: No circular dependency loops
- [ ] **File Accessibility**: All referenced files exist and accessible

### Agent Deployment Validation
- [ ] **Footer Format**: Follows standard agent deployment format
- [ ] **Mission Clarity**: Agent missions clearly defined
- [ ] **Context Specification**: Required context files properly specified
- [ ] **Authority Chain**: Governing documents clearly referenced
- [ ] **Coordination Protocol**: Agent coordination workflow defined

### System Integration Validation
- [ ] **Authority Hierarchy**: Respects system authority structure
- [ ] **Standards Compliance**: Follows all applicable documentation standards
- [ ] **Template Adherence**: Uses appropriate templates where required
- [ ] **Naming Conventions**: File naming follows established patterns
- [ ] **Directory Organization**: Files placed in correct directories

## Success Criteria

### Individual Layer Success
**Concept Layer**: <5 minutes to understand + clear decision guidance + proper references
**Implementation Layer**: Can be executed successfully + complete coverage + proper integration
**Verification Layer**: Objective validation + measurable criteria + authority-based

### System Integration Success
**Navigation**: 2-click access to any related component
**Agent Deployment**: Successful agent coordination and execution
**Quality Assurance**: 100% validation criteria completion
**Maintenance**: Updates can be made without breaking references

## Failure Recovery

### Common Failures
**Concept Too Long**: Extract detailed content to implementation layer
**Missing Procedures**: Add missing steps to implementation layer
**Vague Validation**: Convert subjective criteria to objective measures
**Broken References**: Fix file paths and update link integrity
**Agent Deployment Issues**: Verify footer format and context specifications

### Recovery Actions
1. **Identify Failure Type**: Use appropriate section of this checklist
2. **Apply Correction**: Follow standards for the specific layer
3. **Re-Validate**: Run complete validation again
4. **Test Integration**: Verify cross-layer references work
5. **Document Lessons**: Update standards if systematic issues found
