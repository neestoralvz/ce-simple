# VDD Content Categorization Analysis

**Date**: 2025-07-25 23:39 (Mexico City)  
**Purpose**: Analyze current docs/vision/ content for migration to user-input/ vs docs/  
**Status**: Analysis Phase - No Content Movement Yet

## Categorization Criteria

**user-input/vision/**: Pure user concepts, philosophy, organic user thoughts  
**user-input/technical-requirements/**: Technical specs mentioned by user  
**docs/**: AI-processed, structured implementations based on user input

## Current docs/vision/ Files Analysis

### Likely user-input/vision/ (Pure User Concepts)
- **central-concept.md** → Core mission and philosophy from user
- **command-philosophy.md** → User's vision for command design
- **communication-documentation.md** → User's documentation philosophy
- **development-methodology.md** → User's methodology vision (includes orchestrated workflow)

### Likely user-input/technical-requirements/ (Technical Specs from User)
- **technical-architecture.md** → Technical foundation vision from user
- **execution-strategies.md** → User's parallelization vision

### Likely docs/ (AI Implementations/Interpretations)
- **README.md** → Navigation structure (AI-created organization)
- **application-evolution.md** → Domain applications analysis
- **autonomous-systems.md** → Recovery and learning systems
- **global-system.md** → 86 commands system analysis

## Mixed Content Issues

Several files contain BOTH user vision AND AI implementation:

**development-methodology.md**:
- User concepts: Fresh Start, UltraThink x4 philosophy
- AI implementation: Detailed orchestrated workflow phases

**communication-documentation.md**:
- User concepts: Documentation philosophy
- AI implementation: Specific technical protocols, timestamp protocols

## Migration Strategy Recommendations

### Phase 1: Pure User Content
Copy clear user vision files to user-input/vision/:
- central-concept.md core mission
- command-philosophy.md design principles  
- Basic documentation philosophy

### Phase 2: Technical Requirements
Copy user technical specs to user-input/technical-requirements/:
- technical-architecture.md core technical vision
- execution-strategies.md parallelization vision

### Phase 3: Mixed Content Separation
For files with mixed content:
- Extract pure user concepts → user-input/
- Keep AI implementations → docs/
- Create clear separation

### Phase 4: AI Derivatives
Keep AI-created analysis in docs/:
- Navigation structures
- Implementation analysis
- System organization

## Next Steps

1. **Parallel Content Creation**: Copy (don't move) content to test structure
2. **User Validation**: Confirm categorization aligns with user intent
3. **Gradual Migration**: Move content only after validation
4. **Reference Updates**: Update links after successful migration

**Note**: This analysis preserves existing structure while planning for VDD migration. No breaking changes until user validation.
