```

## Universal 4-Phase Orchestration Framework

### Phase 1: System Validation and Assessment
```markdown
Update TodoWrite: Mark "[PROCESS_NAME] system validation" as in_progress

System Structure Validation:
- Use LS tool to verify [REQUIRED_DIRECTORIES] accessibility
- Validate [CRITICAL_COMPONENTS] existence and integrity  
- Confirm [DEPENDENCY_STRUCTURES] organization
- Ensure system readiness before [PROCESS_TYPE] execution

Complexity Assessment Framework:
```bash
# Universal complexity calculation
scope=$(analyze_[DOMAIN]_scope)
breadth=$(count_[ENTITY]_domains)
interdep=$(analyze_[RELATIONSHIP]_dependencies)  
complexity=$(echo "scale=4; ($scope + $breadth + $interdep) / 3" | bc)
```

Requirements Analysis:
- Determine [SCOPE_TYPE] depth and breadth requirements
- Identify [EXPERTISE_DOMAINS] needed for execution
- Evaluate [DEPENDENCY_TYPE] complexity factors
- Calculate optimal deployment strategy from complexity metrics
```

### Phase 2: Intelligent Agent Deployment  
```markdown
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Intelligent agent deployment" as in_progress

Conditional Deployment Logic:
- If complexity 加THRESHOLD_1]: Deploy `/[PRIMARY_COMMAND]` for [PRIMARY_PURPOSE]
- If [METRIC_TYPE] 加THRESHOLD_2]: Deploy `/[SECONDARY_COMMAND]` for [SECONDARY_PURPOSE]  
- If [CONDITION_TYPE] detected: Deploy `/[SPECIALIZED_COMMAND_1]` for [SPECIALIZED_PURPOSE_1]
- If [CONDITION_TYPE] detected: Deploy `/[SPECIALIZED_COMMAND_2]` for [SPECIALIZED_PURPOSE_2]

Parallel Coordination Protocol:
- Execute simultaneous Task Tool deployment for maximum efficiency
- Monitor agent initialization and readiness status
- Validate successful deployment before proceeding to execution
- Implement retry mechanisms for deployment failures
```

### Phase 3: Execution Coordination and Monitoring
```markdown  
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "[PROCESS_NAME] coordination and monitoring" as in_progress

Parallel Execution Management:
- Monitor Task Tool agent progress and execution status
- Track [DELIVERABLE_TYPE] completion across all deployed agents
- Coordinate inter-agent communication and dependency management
- Resolve coordination bottlenecks and execution issues

Intermediate Result Collection:
- Gather partial [OUTPUT_TYPE] from active agents
- Validate [QUALITY_METRIC] and completeness standards
- Identify gaps requiring additional [PROCESS_TYPE]
- Adjust execution strategy based on intermediate findings
```

### Phase 4: Result Aggregation and Validation
```markdown
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "[PROCESS_NAME] result aggregation" as in_progress

Comprehensive Result Synthesis:
- Collect final outputs from all deployed Task Tool agents
- Synthesize findings with pattern extraction and conflict resolution
- Resolve discrepancies between agent [OUTPUT_TYPES]
- Generate comprehensive [DELIVERABLE_NAME] with complete coverage

Systematic Validation Protocol:
```bash
# Universal completion validation
total_scope=$(calculate_total_[SCOPE_TYPE])
covered_scope=$(get_covered_[SCOPE_TYPE])
completeness=$(echo "scale=4; $covered_scope * 100 / $total_scope" | bc)
```

Quality Assurance Checks:
- Verify request fulfillment 加COMPLETION_THRESHOLD]% scope coverage
- Confirm all Task Tool agents completed successfully
- Validate learning patterns captured and documented  
- Ensure system integrity maintained 加INTEGRITY_THRESHOLD]%

Failure Recovery Protocol:
- If validation fails: Add TodoWrite task "Resolve [PROCESS_NAME] gap: [SPECIFIC_ISSUE]"
- Re-deploy agents with enhanced [PROCESS_TYPE] protocols
- Recalculate complexity using refined assessment parameters
- Re-execute phases with adjusted scope and strategy

Update TodoWrite: Complete all [COMMAND_NAME] tasks
Add follow-up: "[COMMAND_NAME] complete with comprehensive [DELIVERABLE_TYPE] ready"
```

### Universal Principles for Any Command Type

1. **Structure Consistency**: Always maintain 4-phase execution framework
2. **Mathematical Precision**: Use 4-decimal precision for all calculations  
3. **Parallel Optimization**: Default to concurrent execution unless dependencies exist
4. **Error Resilience**: Include comprehensive failure handling and recovery
5. **Learning Integration**: Capture patterns and improve execution over time
6. **Foundation Integration**: Leverage 00-core infrastructure when applicable

### Adaptation Guidelines by Command Category

**Discovery Commands**: Focus on investigation breadth and information gathering
**Analysis Commands**: Emphasize depth, accuracy, and systematic evaluation  
**Execution Commands**: Prioritize efficiency, parallel processing, and deliverable quality
**Validation Commands**: Concentrate on verification, quality assurance, and compliance
**Maintenance Commands**: Focus on system health, optimization, and reliability
