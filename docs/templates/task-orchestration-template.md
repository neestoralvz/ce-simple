# Task Orchestration Template

## Purpose
Template for designing parallel task execution strategies using Claude Code's Task Tool.

## Orchestration Principles

### Task Independence
Design tasks that can execute simultaneously:
- Avoid shared resource dependencies
- Minimize information dependencies between tasks
- Structure tasks for parallel processing
- Plan independent validation approaches

### Load Distribution
Balance work across parallel tasks:
- Distribute complexity evenly
- Assign similar execution time requirements
- Group related operations efficiently
- Optimize for concurrent processing

## Task Design Patterns

### Discovery Tasks
Structure exploration activities:
- Search specific areas or patterns
- Explore different aspects simultaneously
- Gather information from multiple sources
- Map system landscape in parallel

### Analysis Tasks
Organize analytical work:
- Process different data sets concurrently
- Apply various analytical approaches
- Examine multiple perspectives simultaneously
- Generate insights from parallel analysis

### Creation Tasks
Structure generative work:
- Build components independently
- Create different sections simultaneously
- Generate alternatives in parallel
- Develop solutions concurrently

### Validation Tasks
Organize quality assurance:
- Test different aspects simultaneously
- Validate multiple criteria in parallel
- Execute various verification approaches
- Confirm requirements from multiple angles

## Wave Deployment Strategy

### Wave Planning
Structure multi-phase execution:
- Phase 1: Broad exploration and discovery
- Phase 2: Focused analysis and understanding
- Phase 3: Targeted creation and development
- Phase 4: Comprehensive validation and testing

### Inter-Wave Dependencies
Manage information flow between waves:
- Define required outputs from previous wave
- Plan information handoff mechanisms
- Structure dependency management
- Ensure wave completion criteria

## Task Instruction Design

### Clear Specifications
Write effective task instructions:
- State objective clearly and specifically
- Define expected output format
- Specify success criteria
- Include necessary context information

### Actionable Directives
Structure instructions for execution:
- Use action verbs and direct language
- Provide specific steps when needed
- Include examples for clarity
- Specify deliverable requirements

## Result Aggregation

### Collection Strategy
Plan result gathering approach:
- Define result format requirements
- Plan information synthesis methods
- Structure comparative analysis
- Organize priority ranking systems

### Integration Methods
Combine parallel task results:
- Merge complementary findings
- Resolve conflicting information
- Synthesize comprehensive understanding
- Generate unified recommendations

## Quality Control

### Task Monitoring
Track parallel execution:
- Monitor task completion status
- Identify potential bottlenecks
- Detect quality issues early
- Plan intervention strategies

### Result Validation
Ensure output quality:
- Verify task completion criteria
- Validate result accuracy
- Check information consistency
- Confirm requirement fulfillment

## Optimization Techniques

### Performance Tuning
Enhance execution efficiency:
- Adjust task complexity balance
- Optimize resource allocation
- Minimize redundant operations
- Streamline result processing

### Adaptive Strategies
Respond to execution conditions:
- Adjust task scope based on results
- Reallocate resources as needed
- Modify approach based on discoveries
- Scale complexity appropriately
