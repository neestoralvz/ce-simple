# Command Templates - Unified Template System

## Purpose
Consolidated command templates providing standardized structure, P55/P56 compliance, and enforcement patterns for all ce-simple command development.

## Template Categories

### 1. Basic Command Template
```markdown
# /command-name - Command Title

## Purpose
[Single sentence describing what this command accomplishes]

## Principles and Guidelines
- **Self-Contained Design**: Embed complete execution requirements without external dependencies
- **Parallel Optimization**: Design for concurrent execution using Task Tool orchestration
- **Natural Language Instructions**: Use ‚â§15 words per instruction for clarity
- **Standards Compliance**: Maintain ‚â§150 lines total command length

## Execution Process

[Phase description with specific actions]
- [Action 1 with concrete deliverable]
- [Action 2 with measurable outcome]
- [Action 3 with validation criteria]

### Phase 2: [Analysis/Design Phase]

### 2. P55/P56 Compliant Command Template
```markdown
# /command-name - Command Title

## Purpose
[Command description with P55/P56 compliance integration]

## üõ°Ô∏è P55/P56 Compliance Framework
**Inherits from**: Universal P55/P56 compliance standards

### Tool Call Execution Protocol
**MANDATORY**: This command executes:
- Real tool calls (never simulation)
- Mathematical calculations via script execution
- Visual announcements before each tool execution
- Complete transparency of all operations
- Evidence trail maintenance for compliance verification

### Mathematical Integration Pattern
```bash
# Load script foundation
source scripts/core/path-helper.sh
source scripts/formulas/context_engineering_formulas.sh

# Execute calculations with ‚â•4 decimal precision
confidence_score=$(calculate_confidence $param1 $param2 $param3)
threshold_compliance=$(calculate_threshold_compliance $score $threshold "gte")

# Validate P55/P56 compliance
echo "P55_COMPLIANCE: $(tool_calls_executed)/$(required_tool_calls) = 100%"
echo "P56_TRANSPARENCY: All operations visible with mathematical precision"
```

## Execution Process
[Standard 4-phase process with P55/P56 integration points]

### Phase 1: Script Foundation Loading
- Load mathematical formula library via tool calls
- Validate script availability and function access
- Initialize compliance tracking and evidence collection

### Phase 2: Execution with Mathematical Validation
- Execute core functionality with tool call integration
- Perform mathematical calculations with ‚â•4 decimal precision
- Maintain visual transparency throughout execution

### Phase 3: Compliance Verification
- Validate 100% tool call execution rate
- Verify mathematical precision and accuracy
- Document execution evidence for audit trail

### Phase 4: Transparent Reporting
- Display execution metrics and compliance status
- Report performance measurements and success criteria
- Update documentation with execution evidence

### Phase 5: P55/P56 Compliant Routing
**Mathematical Command Routing**: Calculate optimal next command using precision algorithms
- **Performance Analysis**: Use mathematical formulas to assess completion metrics
- **Compliance Routing**: Ensure next command recommendations maintain P55/P56 standards
- **Tool Call Integration**: Execute routing calculations via real tool calls (never simulation)
- **Handoff Protocol**: "Next: /command ([calculated_priority]) - [mathematical_rationale]"
- **Evidence Trail**: Document routing calculations with ‚â•4 decimal precision

```bash
# Calculate routing priority with mathematical precision
routing_score=$(calculate_routing_priority $completion_metrics $context_factors)
echo "ROUTING_DECISION: Priority=$(printf "%.4f" $routing_score) Command=/[recommended]"
```

## Success Metrics
- **P55 Compliance**: 100% tool call execution (0% simulation)
- **P56 Transparency**: ‚â•95% execution visibility
- **Mathematical Precision**: ‚â•4 decimal places accuracy
- **Performance**: ‚â§2.0s execution time

### Customization Instructions
1. **Replace all bracketed placeholders** with command-specific content
2. **Adapt phase descriptions** to match command functionality
3. **Maintain structural consistency** across all commands
