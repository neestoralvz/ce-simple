**Updated**: 2025-07-24 12:54 (Mexico City)

## STP-Compliant Governance Structure

### Propósito STP

Framework de governance que mantiene la excelencia arquitectural del sistema de comandos mediante aplicación meticulosa de los 33 principios, asegurando evolución controlada con Simplicidad Técnica Pragmática como filtro primario obligatorio.

## Governance Authority Structure

### Principle-Based Authority Hierarchy:
```yaml
Level 1 - STP Foundation (ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY):
  Authority: Simplicidad Técnica Pragmática (12 componentes)
  Enforcement: Blocking - no development proceeds without STP compliance
  Scope: ALL system components without exception
  
Level 2 - Development Principles (FUNDAMENTAL AUTHORITY):
  Authority: 33 principios in 6 tiers
  Enforcement: Progressive - tier-based validation and compliance
  Scope: All architectural and implementation decisions

Level 3 - Vision Authority (DIRECTIONAL AUTHORITY):  
  Authority: docs/vision/ directory contents
  Enforcement: Alignment requirement - all development serves vision
  Scope: Strategic direction and system evolution

Level 4 - Implementation Authority (TECHNICAL AUTHORITY):
  Authority: Command architecture and shared patterns
  Enforcement: Consistency requirement - pattern adherence mandatory
  Scope: Technical implementation standards and quality
```

## Command Standards Framework

### New Command Creation Standards:

#### Tier 0 - STP Mandatory Compliance:
```yaml
Pre-Development Requirements (BLOCKING):
  1. STP Pre-Filter Validation:
     - Complete 12-component STP assessment
     - 12/12 passing score REQUIRED
     - Evidence documentation MANDATORY
     - No exceptions or waivers permitted
     
  2. STP Integration Validation:
     - Cross-component integration assessment
     - System coherence maintenance
     - Authority hierarchy respect
     - No conflicts with existing STP compliance

STP Governance Protocol:
  Step 1: Concept STP Assessment (2 minutes)
    - Elevator pitch test (≤30 seconds explanation)
    - Single purpose test (exactly one responsibility)
    - Simplicity test (simplest effective solution)
    
  Step 2: Complete STP Validation (10 minutes)
    - All 12 STP components validated
    - Evidence collection for each component
    - Integration impact assessment
    
  Step 3: STP Authority Confirmation (5 minutes)
    - Authority hierarchy compliance
    - System integration validation
    - Final STP approval required

Blocking Conditions:
  - ANY STP component failure blocks all development

Principle Non-Compliance:
  Action: Deprecation with remediation timeline
  Timeline: 2-week remediation period
  Process: Compliance restoration or replacement
  
Usage Pattern Changes:
  Action: Planned deprecation with migration path
  Timeline: 6-month deprecation cycle
  Process: User migration support and alternatives

Technical Obsolescence:
  Action: Graceful deprecation with replacement
  Timeline: 3-month transition period
  Process: Full replacement provision and user migration
```

#### Deprecation Process:
```yaml
