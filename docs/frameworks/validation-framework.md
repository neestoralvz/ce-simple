# Validation Framework

## Purpose
Unified validation framework consolidating quality assurance, verification protocols, cross-reference analysis, and validation standards across all system operations.

## Core Validation Framework

### Verification Protocol
All system operations use exhaustive verification by default with 3x verification protocol, multi-vector validation, and complete evidence trails.

#### Three-Layer Verification

**Layer 1 - Structural Validation**
- Directory structure integrity (docs/, context/, .claude/)
- File existence verification before claims
- Cross-reference link validation
- Template compliance checking

**Layer 2 - Content Validation**
- Information accuracy verification
- Content duplication detection
- Quality threshold enforcement (85% minimum)
- Anti-bias protocol compliance

**Layer 3 - Functional Validation**
- Command execution verification
- Workflow completion validation
- Performance benchmark compliance
- User experience standards

### Exploration Protocol
Never claim file/resource existence without first using exploration tools.

#### Exploration Requirements
**Before ANY Claims**:
- Use LS tool to verify directory structure
- Use Glob tool to discover actual files
- Use Grep tool to validate content claims
- Use Read tool to confirm file contents

**Tool Call Standards**:
- Minimum 3:1 ratio of actual tools to documentation lines
- Real exploration before any existence statements
- Evidence-based claims only
- Complete verification trails

## Cross-Reference Analysis

### Matrix Generation Protocol
Execute before any solution development to prevent failures through systematic structural assessment.

#### Primary Analysis Dimensions

**Problem Domain Mapping**
- Issue identification and classification
- Subsystem identification
- Impact scope assessment
- Dependency chain analysis

**Failure Mode Analysis**
- Historical failure patterns
- Potential failure modes
- Risk probability assessment
- Impact severity evaluation

**Cross-System Dependencies**
- Internal interdependencies
- External service dependencies
- Data flow mapping
- Configuration dependencies

### Implementation Process

**Domain Mapping Phase**
- Map problem to system architecture
- Identify affected components
- Document dependencies
- Assess interaction complexity

**Failure Analysis Phase**
- Enumerate failure modes per component
- Assess historical patterns
- Evaluate cascade potential
- Document detection methods

**Risk Quantification Phase**
- Calculate Risk Priority Numbers (RPN)
- Prioritize by RPN scores
- Identify critical paths
- Document mitigation requirements

### Assessment Checkpoints
- Pre-solution validation: Complete matrix before design
- Exploration sufficiency: Validate discovery completion
- Risk threshold verification: Ensure acceptable levels
- Mitigation planning: Document prevention strategies

## Quality Assurance Standards

### Health Scoring Framework

**Structural Health (70% weight)**
- Directory Integrity: 25% (Proper folder structure)
- File Organization: 20% (Logical file placement)
- Cross-Reference Health: 15% (Valid internal links)
- Template Compliance: 10% (Adherence to standards)

**Content Health (60% weight)**
- Information Accuracy: 30% (Factual correctness)
- Content Relevance: 25% (User value assessment)
- Uniqueness Score: 20% (Duplication avoidance)
- Completeness Rating: 15% (Comprehensive coverage)

**Functional Health (65% weight)**
- Execution Success: 35% (Command completion rates)
- Performance Metrics: 25% (Speed and efficiency)
- User Satisfaction: 20% (Experience quality)
- Error Rates: 20% (Failure frequency)

### Quality Thresholds

**Minimum Standards**
- Overall Health Score: ≥85%
- Structural Integrity: ≥90%
- Content Accuracy: ≥90%
- Functional Performance: ≥85%
- User Satisfaction: ≥80%

**Critical Thresholds**
- Below 85%: Immediate optimization required
- Below 75%: Emergency intervention protocol
- Below 65%: System integrity compromise
- Below 50%: Complete system review needed

## Anti-Bias Enforcement

### Prohibited Content
- Meta-documentation: Files about the system itself
- Auto-timestamped files: YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM patterns
- Duplicate content: Files repeating existing information
- Template placeholders: Empty or near-empty templates
- System self-analysis: Recursive documentation

### Conditional Creation Rules
- Max 2-3 context files per session
- User value requirement: Direct user benefit only
- Unique content only: No overlapping information
- Organized structure: Appropriate subdirectories

### Permitted Content
- Genuine discoveries from explore-codebase with new insights
- Research findings from explore-web with external patterns
- Learning patterns from capture-learnings with validated insights
- Command complexity analysis with quantifiable metrics
- Implementation recommendations with actionable strategies

## Validation Execution Protocols
