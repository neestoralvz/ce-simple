# Task Orchestration Architecture

## 🎼 Core Architecture

The Task Tool is Claude Code's mechanism for creating sub-agents that execute work in parallel, transforming slash commands from simple scripts into powerful workflow orchestrators.

## 🛠️ Task Tool Capabilities

### Technical Specifications
- **Concurrent Limit**: Up to 10 sub-agents
- **Tool Access**: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash
- **Restrictions**: No Task Tool access, no slash command invocation
- **Execution Model**: True parallelism with independent contexts

### Sub-Agent Architecture
```yaml
Sub-Agent Properties:
  - Independent execution context
  - Full tool access (except Task)
  - Cannot see other sub-agents
  - Cannot access parent context
  - Must receive complete instructions
```

## 🎯 Orchestration Patterns

### Primary Patterns
- **Seven-Parallel-Tasks**: Component development (7x speedup)
- **Scatter-Gather**: Information collection and synthesis
- **Wave Deployment**: Multi-stage complex workflows
- **Competitive Redundancy**: Critical operations reliability

See [task-orchestration-details.md](task-orchestration-details.md) for complete pattern specifications and implementation examples.

## 📋 Task Instruction Framework

### Key Components
- **Clear Task Name**: Single focused objective
- **Complete Context**: All necessary background
- **Structured Steps**: Specific actionable items
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes
- **Output Format**: Consistent structured results

### Common Pitfalls
- Vague instructions
- Missing context
- No success criteria
- Assumed knowledge

See [task-orchestration-details.md](task-orchestration-details.md) for complete instruction templates and examples.

## 🔧 Task Design Principles

### Task Independence
Design tasks for optimal parallel execution:
- Avoid shared resource dependencies
- Minimize information dependencies between tasks
- Structure tasks for simultaneous processing
- Plan independent validation approaches

### Load Distribution
Balance work across parallel tasks:
- Distribute complexity evenly across tasks
- Assign similar execution time requirements
- Group related operations efficiently
- Optimize for concurrent processing capacity

### Task Categories

**Discovery Tasks**: Search specific areas, explore different aspects simultaneously, gather information from multiple sources

**Analysis Tasks**: Process different data sets concurrently, apply various analytical approaches, examine multiple perspectives

**Creation Tasks**: Build components independently, create different sections simultaneously, generate solutions concurrently

**Validation Tasks**: Test different aspects simultaneously, validate multiple criteria in parallel, execute various verification approaches

## 🌊 Wave Deployment Strategy

### Multi-Phase Execution
Structure complex workflows across waves:
- **Wave 1**: Broad exploration and discovery
- **Wave 2**: Focused analysis and understanding  
- **Wave 3**: Targeted creation and development
- **Wave 4**: Comprehensive validation and testing

### Inter-Wave Dependencies
Manage information flow between execution phases:
- Define required outputs from previous wave
- Plan information handoff mechanisms
- Structure dependency management protocols
- Ensure wave completion criteria are met

## 📊 Result Aggregation

### Collection Strategy
- Define consistent result format requirements
- Plan information synthesis methods
- Structure comparative analysis approaches
- Organize priority ranking systems

### Integration Methods
- Merge complementary findings effectively
- Resolve conflicting information systematically
- Synthesize comprehensive understanding
- Generate unified actionable recommendations

## 🚀 Advanced Techniques

### Core Techniques
- **Git WorkTree Integration**: Conflict-free parallel development
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar operations for efficiency
- **Dynamic Task Generation**: Create tasks based on discovery

See [task-orchestration-details.md](task-orchestration-details.md) for complete implementation details and advanced strategies.

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### Core Guidelines
- Always parallel first
- Batch wisely
- Limit scope
- Clear boundaries

### Resource Management
- 10-task limit with queuing
- Token efficiency focus
- Time boxing approach
- Error budget planning

See [task-orchestration-details.md](task-orchestration-details.md) for detailed optimization strategies and metrics.

## 🎭 Real-World Applications

### Success Stories
- **Large-Scale Refactoring**: 4 hours → 15 minutes (50 files)
- **Bug Hunt Operations**: 2 days → 30 minutes (parallel testing)
- **Feature Development**: 1 week → 1 day (concurrent creation)

See [task-orchestration-details.md](task-orchestration-details.md) for complete case study breakdowns and metrics.
