# Discovery Pattern

## Purpose
Pattern for orchestrating parallel exploration tasks to map system landscape and identify key patterns.

## Core Methodology

### Four-Phase Discovery Approach
Execute systematic exploration through parallel phases:
1. Broad Exploration - Map system landscape
2. Deep Investigation - Examine key areas
3. Pattern Recognition - Identify recurring structures
4. Insight Synthesis - Generate actionable understanding

### Parallel Execution Strategy
Deploy multiple discovery tasks simultaneously:
- Execute independent exploration streams
- Cover different system aspects concurrently
- Gather comprehensive information in parallel
- Synthesize findings from multiple perspectives

## Scalability Adaptations

### Small Codebases (< 1000 files)
Focus discovery effort:
- Deploy 3-4 parallel exploration tasks
- Emphasize depth over breadth
- Complete thorough component analysis
- Generate detailed architectural understanding

### Medium Codebases (1000-10000 files)
Balance breadth and depth:
- Use 5-7 parallel discovery tasks
- Combine broad mapping with focused investigation
- Identify key architectural patterns
- Generate strategic system understanding

### Large Codebases (> 10000 files)
Manage complexity through strategic exploration:
- Deploy full parallel task capacity
- Use hierarchical discovery approach
- Focus on architectural boundaries
- Generate high-level system maps

## Discovery Tasks Structure

### Broad Exploration Tasks
Map system landscape:
- Survey overall architecture and structure
- Identify major components and boundaries
- Catalog key technologies and frameworks
- Document entry points and interfaces

### Deep Investigation Tasks
Examine specific areas:
- Analyze critical components in detail
- Understand complex business logic
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Document security and data flow patterns

### Pattern Recognition Tasks
Identify recurring structures:
- Find architectural patterns across system
- Identify code organization principles
- Document naming and structure conventions
- Catalog common implementation approaches

### Insight Synthesis Tasks
Generate actionable understanding:
- Combine findings from all exploration tasks
- Identify key opportunities and challenges
- Generate strategic recommendations
- Create actionable improvement plans

## Success Factors

### Comprehensive Coverage
Ensure thorough exploration:
- Cover all major system areas
- Investigate critical functionality paths
- Examine edge cases and error handling
- Document key integration points

### Pattern Focus
Emphasize pattern discovery:
- Look for recurring architectural structures
- Identify consistent implementation approaches
- Document successful design patterns
- Catalog effective problem-solving strategies

### Actionable Results
Generate practical insights:
- Provide clear system understanding
- Identify specific improvement opportunities
- Generate implementable recommendations
- Create useful reference documentation
