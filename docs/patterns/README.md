# Dynamic Pattern Storage System

**Last Updated: 2025-07-23**

## Purpose

Dynamic repository for capturing, tracking, and evolving patterns discovered during development. Each pattern maintains internal timestamp logging for evolution tracking without filename complexity.

## Pattern Categories

### Technology Patterns
- **Claude Code Integration**: Task Tools, communication protocols, tool optimization
- **MCP Integration**: Context 7, real-time research, external data sources
- **Git Workflows**: WorkTrees, parallel development, automated commits

### Workflow Patterns  
- **Agent Coordination**: Wave-based deployment, parallel execution, result synthesis
- **Error Resolution**: Root cause analysis, logging integration, systematic debugging
- **Quality Assurance**: PTS validation, automated compliance, pattern capture

### Discovery Patterns
- **Research Insights**: External technology research, best practice identification
- **System Evolution**: Architecture improvements, capability expansions
- **User Insights**: Vision evolution, requirement clarification, workflow optimization

## Usage Guidelines

### Pattern Creation
1. **Use Template**: Follow standard pattern template structure
2. **Clear Naming**: Descriptive names that indicate pattern purpose
3. **Internal Logging**: Timestamp entries inside file, not filename
4. **Context Documentation**: Include when/why pattern applies

### Pattern Evolution
1. **Timestamp Updates**: Add evolution entries with clear timestamps
2. **Impact Assessment**: Document changes and their effects
3. **Relationship Mapping**: Update cross-references as patterns evolve
4. **Deprecation Management**: Mark outdated patterns appropriately

### Pattern Application
1. **Pattern Matching**: Identify applicable patterns for current context
2. **Adaptation**: Modify patterns based on specific requirements
3. **Combination**: Use multiple patterns together effectively
4. **Feedback Capture**: Document pattern effectiveness in real usage
