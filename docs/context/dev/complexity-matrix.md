# Command Complexity Matrix

## Purpose
Complexity scoring analysis for 15 commands with implementation guidance.

## Scoring Methodology
- **Content Volume** (25%): Lines of documentation/implementation 
- **Tool Operations** (30%): Number and complexity of tool calls
- **Dependencies** (20%): Integration with other commands
- **Cognitive Load** (15%): Mental processing requirements
- **Implementation** (10%): Technical complexity of execution

See [command-complexity-details.md](command-complexity-details.md) for complete individual command analysis.

## Implementation Patterns by Complexity

### Maximum Complexity Commands
**Characteristics**: Meta-orchestration, dynamic decision trees, multiple integrations
**Tool Usage**: 20+ operations, parallel execution, competitive redundancy
**Implementation**: Advanced behavioral reinforcement, complex error handling
**Maintenance**: High cognitive load, requires expertise for modifications

### High Complexity Commands
**Characteristics**: Parallel task deployment, multi-source analysis, intelligent automation
**Tool Usage**: 10-20 operations, systematic parallel execution
**Implementation**: Structured orchestration, comprehensive error recovery
**Maintenance**: Moderate cognitive load, clear patterns for modifications

### Medium Complexity Commands
**Characteristics**: Focused responsibilities, systematic workflows, standard integrations
**Tool Usage**: 5-10 operations, selective parallel execution
**Implementation**: Standard patterns, basic error handling
**Maintenance**: Low cognitive load, straightforward modifications

### Low Complexity Commands
**Characteristics**: Single responsibility, direct tool usage, minimal dependencies
**Tool Usage**: 2-5 operations, mostly sequential execution
**Implementation**: Simple patterns, basic validation
**Maintenance**: Minimal cognitive load, easy modifications

## Development Guidelines

### Complexity Management
- **Target Range**: 4.0-6.0 for optimal balance
- **Maximum Threshold**: 8.0 before requiring decomposition
- **Minimum Viable**: 2.0 for meaningful automation

### Pattern Application
- **High Complexity**: Use for meta-orchestration and discovery workflows
- **Medium Complexity**: Standard for most command implementations
- **Low Complexity**: Reserve for simple utilities and maintenance tasks

### Optimization Strategies
- **Reduce Dependencies**: Minimize cross-command integrations
- **Simplify Tool Usage**: Batch operations for efficiency
- **Extract Implementation**: Use progressive disclosure for technical details
- **Standardize Patterns**: Apply consistent orchestration approaches

## Quality Metrics

### Complexity Distribution
- Maximum (3 commands): 20% - Acceptable for core orchestration
- High (4 commands): 27% - Good balance for feature commands
- Medium (4 commands): 27% - Optimal for standard workflows
- Low (4 commands): 27% - Necessary for utility functions

### Performance Indicators
- **Average Complexity**: 5.6 - Well-balanced system
- **Standard Deviation**: 2.1 - Appropriate complexity variation
- **Maintenance Load**: Distributed across complexity levels
- **Evolution Capacity**: Room for growth within acceptable ranges

## Recommendations

### System Health
- Complexity distribution is well-balanced
- Clear patterns for each complexity level
- Appropriate specialization for different use cases
- Manageable maintenance overhead

### Future Development
- Maintain 4.0-6.0 target range for new commands
- Consider decomposition for any command exceeding 8.0
- Apply progressive disclosure for technical complexity
- Use established patterns for consistency
