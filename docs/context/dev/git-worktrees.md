# Git WorkTrees + AI Agents Guide

## Purpose
Parallel AI agent orchestration using Git worktrees for 40-70% productivity improvement.

## Key Benefits
- Up to 10+ concurrent AI agents working simultaneously
- Isolated branches maintaining deep context without interference
- Proven scaling with validated parallel execution

See [git-worktrees-details.md](git-worktrees-details.md) for complete technical implementation.

## Technical Architecture

### Directory Structure
```
project/
├── .git/           # Shared metadata
├── main/           # Main branch
├── trees/
│   ├── claude1/    # feature/auth-system
│   ├── claude2/    # feature/api-optimization  
│   ├── claude3/    # feature/ui-components
│   └── claude4/    # docs/implementation-guide
└── shared/
    ├── .env        # Environment variables
    ├── CLAUDE.md   # AI coordination file
    └── .cursorrules # AI assistant config
```

### Core Benefits
- Context isolation with dedicated task focus
- No branch switching eliminates stashing and context loss
- Independent testing while developing
- True simultaneous development vs sequential execution

## Implementation

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Create worktree with new branch
git worktree add -b feature/new-feature ../trees/claude1

# Create from existing branch  
git worktree add ../trees/claude2 existing-branch

# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove worktree
git worktree remove ../trees/claude1
```

### Setup Process
1. Initialize worktree structure
2. Configure shared environment
3. Set up AI coordination files
4. Deploy agents to isolated trees
5. Implement merge strategies

## Agent Orchestration

### Coordination Patterns
- **Task Distribution**: Assign specific features to dedicated trees
- **Context Sharing**: Use shared/ directory for common resources
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor each agent's independent progress
- **Merge Strategy**: Coordinate integration through main branch

### Communication Protocol
- CLAUDE.md file maintains coordination state
- Shared environment variables for consistency
- Independent testing and validation
- Coordinated merge timing

## Workflow Integration

### Command Integration
- `/worktree-start`: Initialize parallel development environment
- `/worktree-close`: Coordinate merge and cleanup
- Enhanced productivity through parallel task execution

### Performance Metrics
- 16 parallel web searches: ~90 seconds vs 16+ minutes sequential
- Multiple feature development streams
- Reduced context switching overhead
- Improved focus through isolation

## Best Practices

### Tree Management
- One feature per tree for maximum focus
- Regular synchronization with main branch
- Clean removal of completed trees
- Shared resource coordination

### Agent Coordination
- Clear task boundaries and responsibilities
- Regular progress synchronization
- Conflict resolution protocols
- Quality assurance through independent review

## Success Patterns

### Proven Applications
- Parallel feature development
- Independent research streams
- Simultaneous documentation and implementation
- Multi-track problem solving

### Performance Benefits
- 40-70% productivity improvement
- Reduced cognitive overhead
- Enhanced parallel processing
- Improved task focus and completion
