**Updated**: 2025-07-24 12:54 (Mexico City)

## STP-First Refactoring Methodology

### Propósito STP

Guía práctica para refactorizar comandos existentes hacia compliance completo con 33 principios, aplicando Simplicidad Técnica Pragmática como filtro primario y metodología de refactoring directa, precisa y técnicamente excelente.

## Pre-Refactoring Assessment

### Current Command Analysis

#### Step 1: STP Baseline Assessment
```yaml
Current Commands to Analyze:
  - commands/init-project.md
  - commands/start.md  
  - commands/explore-codebase.md

STP Compliance Check:
  For each command, evaluate:
    Cluster Técnico:
      - Directness: ¿≤3 steps from intent to execution?
      - Precision: ¿100% absolute paths, specific errors?
      - Sufficiency: ¿100% success rate from docs alone?
      - Technical Excellence: ¿≥90% quality, ≤15 complexity?
    
    Cluster Comunicacional:
      - Exactitude: ¿100% verifiable behavior claims?
      - Sobriety: ¿0 marketing language?
      - Structure: ¿100% pattern consistency?
      - Conciseness: ¿≥80% information density?
    
    Cluster Cognitivo:
      - Clarity: ¿≥90% new user comprehension?
      - Coherence: ¿0 integration conflicts?
      - Effectiveness: ¿≥95% completion rate?
      - Pragmatism: ¿≥80% real usage?

Assessment Result Template:
  command: [command_name]
  stp_failures: [list_of_failing_components]
  blocking_issues: [critical_failures_that_block_progression]
  remediation_priority: [high|medium|low]
```

#### Step 2: Tier 1-5 Gap Analysis
```yaml
Principle Gap Assessment:
  Tier 1 (Fundamentals):
    - KISS violations: [complexity_issues]
    - SOLID violations: [architectural_issues]  
    - DRY violations: [duplication_issues]
    - YAGNI violations: [speculative_features]
  
  Tier 2 (Critical):
    - Separation of Concerns: [mixed_responsibilities]
    - Fail Fast: [late_error_detection]
    - Convention over Configuration: [configuration_burden]
    - Least Surprise: [unexpected_behaviors]
  
  Tier 3-5: [similar_analysis_for_higher_tiers]

Gap Priority Matrix:
  - Blocking (STP failures): IMMEDIATE remediation required
  - Critical (Tier 1-2): HIGH priority remediation  
  - Important (Tier 3-4): MEDIUM priority remediation
  - Architecture (Tier 5): LOW priority, optimize after basics
```

## Refactoring Process

### Phase 1: STP Compliance Refactoring (MANDATORY FIRST)

#### STP Component-by-Component Remediation:

**Directness Refactoring:**
```yaml
Current Issue Assessment:
  init-project.md: 5 phases (violates ≤3 steps)
  start.md: 3 phases (borderline, may be acceptable)  
  explore-codebase.md: 5 phases (violates ≤3 steps)

Refactoring Strategy:
  init-project.md:
    Current: Phase 1→2→3→4→5 (5 phases)
    Target: Setup→Execute→Confirm (3 direct steps)
    Eliminated: Complex orchestration, multi-step validation
    Preserved: Essential functionality only

  explore-codebase.md:
    Current: Discovery→Analysis→Validation→Synthesis→Handoff (5 phases)
    Target: Scan→Analyze→Report (3 direct steps)
    Eliminated: Complex cross-validation, synthesis complexity
    Preserved: Core exploration functionality

Refactoring Template:
  # [command]
  
  ## Propósito (STP Directness)
  [One clear sentence - what this does]
  
  ## Ejecución Directa (≤3 steps)
  1. [Direct step with clear input/output]
  2. [Essential processing step]  
  3. [Result delivery step]
  
  ## Resultado
  [Specific, measurable outcome]
```

**Precision Refactoring:**
```yaml
Current Issues:
  - Generic error messages ("An error occurred")
  - Relative path references without context
  - Approximate behavior descriptions

Refactoring Strategy:
  Error Messages:
    Before: "Validation failed"
    After: "Project structure validation failed: missing required directory 'docs/core/'"
  
  Path References:
    Before: "../docs/core/"
    After: "/Users/nalve/ce-simple/docs/core/" (absolute paths)
  
  Behavior Specifications:
    Before: "Analyzes project structure"
    After: "Scans directory structure, identifies file types, reports organization patterns"

Precision Template:
  - All file paths: Absolute references
  - All error messages: Specific cause + specific resolution
  - All behavior claims: 100% verifiable statements
```

**Sufficiency Refactoring:**
```yaml
Current Issues:
  - Missing prerequisite information
  - Incomplete execution guidance
  - Assumptions about user knowledge

Refactoring Strategy:
  Prerequisites: Explicit statement of all requirements
  Execution: Complete step-by-step without gaps
  Knowledge: No assumed prior knowledge
  
Sufficiency Template:
  ## Prerequisites
  [Explicit list of all requirements]
  
  ## Complete Execution
  [Every step specified, no gaps]
  
  ## Success Verification
  [How to confirm successful completion]
```

**Technical Excellence Refactoring:**
```yaml
Current Issues:
  - Over-complex logic structures
  - Unclear command flows
  - Poor error handling

Refactoring Strategy:
  Logic Simplification: Reduce cyclomatic complexity to ≤15
  Flow Clarity: Clear, linear execution paths
  Error Handling: Comprehensive but simple error management
  
Excellence Template:
  - Command logic: Simple, clear, effective
  - Error handling: Comprehensive coverage, clear messages
  - Code quality: Clean, maintainable, well-structured
```

#### STP Cluster Remediation Examples:

**Cluster Comunicacional Refactoring:**
```yaml
Exactitude Issues:
  Before: "Provides project analysis and guidance"
  After: "Scans project directory structure, analyzes file organization patterns, recommends specific next command based on project type and maturity"

Sobriety Issues:
  Before: "Powerful project initialization with intelligent orchestration"  
  After: "Creates git repository, directory structure, and CLAUDE.md file"

Structure Issues:
  Before: Inconsistent section ordering between commands
  After: All commands follow: Purpose→Prerequisites→Execution→Result→Errors

Conciseness Issues:
  Before: 150+ lines with verbose explanations
  After: ≤50 lines with maximum information density
```

**Cluster Cognitivo Refactoring:**
```yaml
Clarity Issues:
  Before: Technical explanations requiring domain knowledge
  After: Clear explanations for new users without training

Coherence Issues:
  Before: Different terminology for similar concepts across commands
  After: Consistent terminology and patterns across all commands

Effectiveness Issues:
  Before: Unclear success criteria
  After: Specific, measurable outcomes with verification steps

Pragmatism Issues:
  Before: Features that sound good but aren't used
  After: Only features with demonstrated real-world value
```

### Phase 2: Tier 1 Refactoring (Fundamentals)

#### KISS Refactoring:
```yaml
Complexity Reduction Strategy:
  init-project.md:
    Remove: Advanced git configuration options
    Remove: Complex template deployment logic
    Remove: Sophisticated error recovery scenarios
    Keep: Essential git init + directory creation + basic documentation
  
  start.md:
    Remove: Multi-factor analysis algorithms
    Remove: Complex decision matrices  
    Remove: Advanced recommendation logic
    Keep: Basic project scan + simple recommendation
  
  explore-codebase.md:
    Remove: Parallel analysis streams
    Remove: Cross-validation logic
    Remove: Sophisticated pattern recognition
    Keep: Directory scan + file categorization + simple report

KISS Template:
  # [command]
  
  ## What It Does (Simple)
  [One sentence, no technical jargon]
  
  ## How It Works (Simple)
  [Simple explanation, no complex logic]
  
  ## Usage (Simple)
  [Straightforward usage, minimal options]
```

#### SOLID Refactoring:

**SRP (Single Responsibility) Refactoring:**
```yaml
Current Violations:
  init-project.md: 
    - Project initialization (primary)
    - Git configuration (secondary)  
    - Documentation generation (secondary)
    - Development environment setup (secondary)

Refactoring Strategy:
  Keep: Project initialization only
  Extract: Advanced git configuration → advanced/init-complete.md
  Extract: Documentation generation → shared/completion.md
  Extract: Environment setup → specialized/setup-environment.md

SRP Template:
  # [command] - [single_responsibility_statement]
  
  ## Single Purpose
  [Exactly one responsibility clearly stated]
  
  ## What It Does NOT Do
  [Explicitly state what's outside scope]
```

**OCP (Open/Closed) Refactoring:**
```yaml
Extension Strategy:
  Core commands: Closed for modification
  Extension mechanism: Advanced/specialized variants
  
Implementation:
  init.md: Basic initialization (closed)
  advanced/init-complete.md: Extended initialization (extension)
  specialized/init-enterprise.md: Enterprise initialization (extension)

OCP Template:
  Core Command: Stable, no future modifications
  Extension Points: Clear paths for enhanced versions
  Extension Interface: Consistent interface across variants
```

#### DRY Refactoring:
```yaml
Duplication Elimination:
  Common Patterns Identified:
    - Input validation logic (duplicated across all commands)
    - Error message formatting (duplicated patterns)
    - Success confirmation logic (repeated patterns)
    - Context analysis logic (similar across commands)

Shared Pattern Creation:
  shared/validation.md: Common validation patterns
  shared/error-handling.md: Standard error patterns  
  shared/completion.md: Success confirmation patterns
  shared/orchestration.md: Common orchestration patterns

DRY Implementation:
  Before: Each command implements own validation
  After: All commands reference @./shared/validation.md
```

#### YAGNI Refactoring:
```yaml
Speculative Feature Removal:
  init-project.md:
    Remove: "Advanced: Add environment variables and advanced tools as needed"
    Remove: "Progressive: Establish comprehensive file hierarchy as permissions allow"
    Keep: Only proven essential initialization features
  
  start.md:
    Remove: "Progressive: Deep needs analysis only when complexity detected"  
    Remove: "Advanced: Comprehensive maturity assessment and development state evaluation"
    Keep: Only basic analysis with proven value
  
  explore-codebase.md:
    Remove: All "Progressive" and "Advanced" conditional complexity
    Remove: Speculative analysis features
    Keep: Only core exploration functionality

YAGNI Validation:
  For each feature: Demonstrate real usage evidence
  For each complexity: Justify with actual user need
  For each option: Confirm active usage in real scenarios
```

### Phase 3: Tier 2-5 Refactoring (Progressive)

#### Tier 2 (Critical) Refactoring:

**Separation of Concerns:**
```yaml
Concern Separation Strategy:
  commands/: Command execution logic only
  shared/: Reusable patterns only
  docs/: Documentation and architecture only
  
Clear Boundaries:
  No command logic in shared patterns
  No shared pattern implementation in commands  
  No documentation mixed with execution logic

Implementation:
  commands/init.md: Pure initialization logic + pattern references
  shared/validation.md: Pure validation patterns + usage guidance
  docs/core/: Pure architectural documentation + principle authority
```

**Fail Fast Implementation:**
```yaml
Early Error Detection:
  Pre-execution validation: All inputs validated before processing
  Environment checks: System requirements verified upfront
  Context validation: Project state confirmed before execution
  
Error Message Quality:
  Specific cause identification
  Clear resolution guidance
  Alternative approaches when applicable
  
Fail Fast Template:
  ## Prerequisites Validation
  [All requirements checked before execution]
  
  ## Early Error Detection  
  [Validation points with specific error messages]
  
  ## Recovery Guidance
  [Clear paths to resolution]
```

#### Tier 3-5 Progressive Enhancement:
```yaml
Architecture Preparation:
  Create directory structure for progressive enhancement:
    commands/: Core commands (Tier 0-2 compliant)
    commands/advanced/: Enhanced functionality (Tier 3-4 compliant)
    commands/specialized/: Expert functionality (Tier 5 compliant)
  
Progressive Implementation:
  Phase 3a: Implement advanced/ variants with Tier 3-4 compliance
  Phase 3b: Implement specialized/ variants with Tier 5 compliance
  Phase 3c: Validate cross-tier integration and user journeys
```

  3. Test user experience with refactored commands
  4. Validate cross-command consistency
  5. Confirm no regression in functionality

Validation Tools:
  - [33-Principle Validation Framework](../core/pts-validation-consolidated.md)
  - [STP Checklist](../core/stp-checklist.md)
  - [Tier Compliance Matrix](../command-architecture/tier-compliance-matrix.md)
```
