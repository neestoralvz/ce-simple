# Context Compaction Examples

**Purpose**: Practical demonstrations of compaction techniques application
**Authority**: Real-world compaction implementations in ce-simple system
**Usage**: Reference for understanding compaction technique effectiveness

## Successful Compaction Cases

### CLAUDE.md Optimization
**Before State**: 147 lines with redundant content and verbose sections
**After State**: 50 lines with strategic references and compacted structure
**Techniques Applied**:
- Header compression: Multi-level headers → Bold inline labels
- Pipe separation: Vertical bullet lists → Horizontal pipe-separated format
- Symbol substitution: Word replacement with arrows and mathematical symbols
- Reference consolidation: Inline explanations → @path/file.md references

**Results**: 66% line reduction while maintaining complete functionality

### CLAUDE_RULES.md Optimization  
**Before State**: 179 lines with verbose role definitions and expanded sections
**After State**: 97 lines maintaining all critical information and authority
**Techniques Applied**:
- Role definition compaction: Multi-line descriptions → Pipe-separated format
- List horizontalization: Vertical structure → Horizontal with pipe separation
- Section consolidation: Related content merged using smart line breaks
- Quality preservation: No semantic loss during compression

**Results**: 46% line reduction with enhanced readability

## Component Extraction Examples

### Context Compaction Techniques Self-Application
**Extraction Applied**: Validation checklist and examples extracted to specialized files
**Components Extracted**:
- Validation checklist → @docs/validation/context-compaction-checklist.md
- Practical examples → @docs/examples/compaction-examples.md (this file)

**Method**: Applied extraction criteria assessment to own content
**Result**: Main file reduced from 120 to ~95 lines while preserving all functionality

## Technique Effectiveness Matrix

### Header Compression
**Effectiveness**: High (3-5 line reduction per section)
**Best Use**: Documentation with multiple subsections
**Limitation**: Must maintain logical hierarchy

### Pipe Separation  
**Effectiveness**: Medium-High (2-4 line reduction per list)
**Best Use**: Short, related list items
**Limitation**: Items must be scannable when horizontal

### Symbol Substitution
**Effectiveness**: Low-Medium (1-2 line reduction per document)
**Best Use**: Frequent word patterns (and, arrow, less than)
**Limitation**: Symbols must be universally understood

### Reference Consolidation
**Effectiveness**: Very High (10-20 line reduction potential)
**Best Use**: Detailed explanations that can be externalized
**Limitation**: Must maintain logical reference flow

### Component Extraction
**Effectiveness**: Very High (15-30 line reduction potential)
**Best Use**: Reusable content (checklists, templates, examples)
**Limitation**: Requires careful reference management

## Anti-Pattern Examples

### Failed Compaction Attempts
**Checklist Compression**: Attempted to compact validation criteria → Lost functionality
**Resolution**: Extract checklists instead of compacting them

**Over-Symbolization**: Excessive symbol use → Reduced readability
**Resolution**: Use symbols sparingly for common patterns only

**Broken References**: Compacted references lost precision → Navigation issues
**Resolution**: Maintain exact @path/file.md:line format

**Key Learning**: Extraction before compaction yields better results while preserving content quality and functionality.
