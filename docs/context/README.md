# Context - System Knowledge Hub

**Updated**: 2025-07-26 | **Authority**: Accumulated system knowledge and experience  
**Purpose**: Repository of learned patterns, proven implementations, and contextual understanding

## Context Categories

### **Implementation Experience**
- **[Implementation/](implementation/)** - Practical guides and real implementation examples
- **[Commands/](commands/)** - Command-specific implementation documentation and patterns

### **Proven Patterns** 
- **[Patterns/](patterns/)** - Validated patterns and communication protocols
- **[Examples/](examples/)** - Working examples and practical applications

### **Research & Methodology**
- **[Methodologies/](methodologies/)** - Research methods and analytical frameworks

## Purpose of Context

**Context captures WHAT WE LEARNED** from building and using the VDD system:
- **Implementation Reality**: What actually works vs what was planned
- **Pattern Evolution**: How patterns emerged and proved themselves
- **Practical Wisdom**: Lessons learned from real usage
- **Methodological Insights**: Effective approaches discovered through practice

## Usage

**For Learning**: Understand how the system evolved and what patterns work
**For Decision Making**: Reference proven approaches before creating new solutions
**For Troubleshooting**: Find examples of how similar problems were solved
**For Evolution**: Build on established patterns rather than reinventing
