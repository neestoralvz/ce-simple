# Phase 5: Command Routing and Handoff Pattern

## Technical Pattern Documentation

### Pattern Implementation

**Phase 5 Structure**: Command Routing and Handoff section added as fifth phase in command execution process, following the standard 4-phase structure (Discovery, Analysis, Execution, Validation).

**Auto-Trigger Resolution**: Phase 5 solves the auto-trigger announcement vs. execution gap by embedding routing logic directly within command structure rather than relying on external orchestration.

**Routing Logic Framework**:
```markdown
## Phase 5: Command Routing and Handoff
**Instruction**: Implement intelligent workflow continuation based on [context] results and user context.
Determine optimal next steps:
1. **[Condition Assessment]**: If [criteria], route to [command] with [parameters]...
2. **[Alternative Path]**: For [condition], recommend [command] with [refined parameters]...
3. **[Workflow Integration]**: Connect to [category] workflows for [continuation pattern]...
```

### Implementation Examples

**Filter-Results Pattern** (from `/commands/13-search/filter-results.md`):
- Result Quality Assessment: Routes to immediate use when high-quality results found (70+ score)
- Search Expansion: Routes to `/search-advanced` for insufficient results with refined parameters
- Workflow Integration: Connects to appropriate command categories based on filtering outcomes

**Mathematical Decision Framework**: Uses threshold-based routing with 4-decimal precision for consistent decision criteria across implementations.

### Technical Requirements

**Context Preservation**: Phase 5 must maintain execution context when transitioning between commands to ensure workflow continuity.

**Parameter Passing**: Routing logic includes parameter refinement and context translation for seamless handoffs.

**Fallback Mechanisms**: Each Phase 5 implementation includes fallback routing for edge cases and error conditions.

**Integration Points**: Phase 5 connects with TodoWrite behavioral system for task management and state tracking across command transitions.

### System Integration

**Behavioral Layer**: Phase 5 integrates with TodoWrite system for transparent task progression across command boundaries.

**Orchestration Compatibility**: Pattern works with existing Task Tool orchestration without requiring architectural changes.

**Validation Framework**: Phase 5 routing decisions are validated through existing mathematical assessment and threshold analysis systems.

**Performance Impact**: Minimal overhead as routing logic is embedded within command execution rather than requiring separate orchestration processes.
