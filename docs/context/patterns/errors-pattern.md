# Error Resolution Workflow Pattern

**Pattern Type**: Workflow/Technology
**Status**: Active  
**Complexity**: Complex

## Overview

Systematic error resolution methodology combining deep exploration, visual validation, root cause analysis, and comprehensive logging to achieve integral solutions that address problems at their source.

## Context

Applies when:
- Complex bugs require systematic investigation
- Surface-level fixes have failed or are insufficient
- Multiple related issues may exist across the project
- Visual or browser console errors need investigation
- Root cause analysis is essential for permanent resolution

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Deep Exploration & Evidence Gathering
```markdown
## Visual Evidence Collection
- Take screenshots of error states
- Capture browser console output
- Document error reproduction steps
- Collect system state at error occurrence

## Comprehensive File Analysis
- Identify all files potentially related to the issue
- Examine configuration files, dependencies, and imports
- Check similar patterns elsewhere in the project
- Look for related errors in different components

## Tool Integration
Use Task Tools for parallel exploration:
- File analysis agents for different system areas
- Log analysis agents for error pattern identification
- Configuration validation agents
```

### Phase 2: External Research & Best Practices
```markdown
## Research Strategy
- Context 7 MCP integration for real-time documentation
- Web search for similar error patterns and solutions
- Best practice identification for the specific technology stack
- Case study analysis from successful error resolutions

## Pattern Recognition
- Identify common error patterns in similar contexts
- Research systematic solutions vs quick fixes
- Validate approaches against project architecture
```

### Phase 3: UltraThink x4 Analysis & Diagnosis
```markdown
## Layered Thinking Process
Think (Initial Analysis):
- Basic error understanding and immediate causes

Think Hard (Deeper Investigation):
- Root cause hypothesis development
- System interaction analysis

Think Harder (Comprehensive Assessment):
- Cross-system impact evaluation  
- Solution architecture design

Ultra Think (Integral Solution):
- Long-term prevention strategies
- System-wide improvement opportunities
```

### Phase 4: Integral Solution Implementation
```markdown
## Solution Development
- Design solutions that address root causes
- Implement fixes that prevent similar issues
- Consider system-wide improvements
- Test solutions thoroughly before deployment

## Validation Process
- Verify error resolution in original context
- Test for regression in related areas
- Confirm no new issues introduced
- Document solution effectiveness
```

### Phase 5: Logging Integration & Re-Analysis (If Initial Solution Fails)
```markdown
## Comprehensive Logging Implementation
- Add detailed logging throughout affected systems
- Implement error tracking and monitoring
- Create debug modes for problematic workflows
- Capture runtime state and variable values

## Enhanced Re-Analysis
- Run failed scenarios with comprehensive logging
- Analyze log patterns and error sequences
- Identify missed interaction points
- Use logging context for deeper investigation

## Escalated Resolution
- Apply UltraThink x4 analysis to logged information
- Research advanced debugging techniques
- Consider architectural changes if needed
- Implement monitoring for ongoing issue detection
```

- **System Integration**: Consider solution impact on overall system architecture
- **Prevention Integration**: Build monitoring and prevention into solutions
- **Documentation Requirements**: Comprehensive solution documentation for future reference

## Implementation Considerations

### PTS Compliance Challenges
This workflow pattern is inherently complex due to the systematic nature of error resolution. To maintain PTS compliance:

- **Modular Implementation**: Break into focused, single-responsibility commands
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Provide simple interface for complex underlying process
- **Clear Automation**: Automate routine exploration and analysis tasks
- **Result Focus**: Maintain focus on practical resolution over theoretical completeness

### Command Design Strategy
Consider implementing as coordinated command suite:
- `/debug-explore` - Evidence gathering and initial exploration
- `/debug-research` - External research and best practice identification  
- `/debug-analyze` - UltraThink x4 analysis and solution design
- `/debug-implement` - Solution implementation and validation
- `/debug-monitor` - Ongoing monitoring and prevention

**Critical Note**: This pattern represents complex workflow that requires careful implementation to maintain PTS simplicity principles while providing comprehensive error resolution capabilities.
