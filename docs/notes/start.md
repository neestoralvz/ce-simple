# /start Command - System Entry Point Design

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Primary system entry point enabling intelligent discovery workflow through dynamic questioning and agent orchestration.

## ðŸš€ Core Architecture

### Dynamic Discovery Protocol
**MANDATORY**: Evidence-based context gathering through progressive questioning:
- Project context analysis
- Session objective identification  
- Complexity assessment framework
- Workflow preference discovery

### Intelligence Orchestration Framework
**AUTOMATIC**: Context-driven command deployment:
- Complexity evaluation â†’ worktree activation decision
- Tool requirement assessment â†’ agent selection  
- Workflow optimization â†’ execution sequence planning
- Performance monitoring â†’ real-time adaptation

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Requirements

### Phase 1: Contextual Intelligence
**CRITICAL**: User context discovery through structured questioning:
```
âŸ³ Initial request â†’ dynamic questions â†’ context matrix â†’ complexity assessment
```

### Phase 2: Agent Deployment
**AUTOMATIC**: Intelligent command orchestration based on discovery results:
- `/explore-codebase` â†’ Internal analysis [Complexity: 3-8]
- `/explore-web` â†’ External research [Complexity: 2-6]  
- `/think-layers` â†’ Progressive analysis [Auto-trigger: complex analysis]
- `/worktree-start` â†’ Session isolation [Complexity â‰¥6]

### Phase 3: Execution Coordination
**INTEGRATED**: Workflow management with real-time notifications:
- TodoWrite progress tracking
- Cross-command integration
- Performance optimization
- Result synthesis

## âš¡ Behavioral Requirements

### Conversational Intelligence
- **Natural questioning**: Fluid, context-aware dialogue
- **Adaptive responses**: Question adjustment based on user input
- **Inference capability**: Identify unstated requirements
- **Efficiency optimization**: Minimize unnecessary interrogation

### Workflow Transparency  
- **Plan visualization**: Clear execution roadmap presentation
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time status updates via TodoWrite
- **Decision rationale**: Explanation of agent selection logic
- **Session continuity**: Resume capability for interrupted workflows

## ðŸ“Š Technical Specifications

### Integration Standards
**MANDATORY** compliance with system architecture:
- Writing standards â†’ English 100%, â‰¤130 lines command limit
- Anti-bias protocols â†’ Evidence-based discovery only
- Cross-reference validation â†’ File existence verification required
- Performance standards â†’ 30s <1000 files, 3min 1000-10000 files

### Quality Gates
- **Discovery completeness**: Context matrix 85% population threshold
- **Agent selection accuracy**: Optimal command deployment >90%
- **Workflow efficiency**: Performance targets compliance
- **User satisfaction**: Transparent decision-making process

## ðŸ”— System Integration

### Command Network Integration
**AUTOMATIC**: Seamless workflow continuation through established command ecosystem:
```
âŸ³ /start â†’ discovery â†’ /explore-* â†’ /think-layers â†’ execution â†’ /capture-learnings â†’ /context-optimize
```

### Configuration Adaptability
- User preference learning and storage
- Session template customization
- Workflow optimization based on historical patterns
- Performance adaptation for different project types

**CRITICAL**: All implementation MUST follow architectural principles â†’ pragmatic effectiveness, autocontained commands, LLM optimization, anti-bias processing.
