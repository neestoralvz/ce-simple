# Category Taxonomy: 15-Category System Specification

## Purpose
Detailed specification of the 15-category taxonomy that forms the foundation of ce-simple v2.0 architecture.

## Taxonomy Design Principles

### Semantic Organization
- **Content-based**: Categories defined by semantic intent, not technical implementation
- **Progressive Complexity**: Simple (00-02) → Complex (03-08) → Specialized (09-14)
- **Clear Boundaries**: Distinct responsibility areas with minimal overlap
- **Natural Workflow**: Categories follow logical development and maintenance patterns

### Cross-Category Relations
- **Trigger Chains**: Predictable workflows between categories
- **Support Networks**: Utility categories supporting primary workflows
- **Governance Layers**: Standards and meta-categories ensuring system integrity
- **Learning Loops**: Continuous improvement through inter-category feedback

## Implementation Guidelines

### Category Selection Rules
1. **Primary Function**: Choose category based on command's primary purpose
2. **Secondary Relations**: Document cross-category dependencies clearly
3. **User Intent**: Align with user's mental model and expectations
4. **System Efficiency**: Optimize for workflow performance and clarity

### Cross-Category Orchestration
- **Trigger Protocols**: Standardized inter-category communication
- **Data Passing**: Consistent data structures between categories
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure and recovery across categories
- **Performance**: Parallel execution where possible, sequential where necessary

---

**Implementation Success**: All commands properly categorized with clear relationships, enabling intelligent orchestration and emergent system behaviors through the 15-category taxonomy.

**Next Steps**: Use this taxonomy for command migration and new command development, ensuring consistent application of category principles and relationships.
