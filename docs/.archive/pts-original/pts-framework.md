## Governing Principle Definition

**PRAGMATIC TECHNICAL SIMPLICITY (PTS)**: The absolute meta-principle governing all other principles in the ce-simple system.

Direct, forceful, and technically precise solutions that say exactly what's necessary at the exact point, with sober, concise, clear, coherent, effective, and pragmatic structure.

## The 12 PTS Components

### Technical Cluster

#### 1. **Directness**

## Meticulous Application Framework

### Exhaustive Compliance Principle

**"All 12 PTS components are applied meticulously and exhaustively in every line of code, document, command, and architectural decision. NO EXCEPTIONS."**

### PTS Validation Process

#### Phase 1: Pre-evaluation (2 minutes)
```markdown
- [ ] What is the specific purpose? (Clarity test)
- [ ] Does it solve exactly one problem? (Sufficiency test)  
- [ ] Uses ≤3 steps to achieve objective? (Directness test)
- [ ] Does it work without additional configuration? (Pragmatism test)
```

#### Phase 2: Complete Evaluation (10 minutes)
- Validate all 12 PTS components individually
- Verify absence of blocking criteria
- Measure quantitative metrics where applicable
- Document trade-offs and decisions

#### Phase 3: Contextual Validation (5 minutes)  
- Coherence with Tier 1-5 principles
- Alignment with docs/vision/
- Integration with existing system
- Impact on maintainability

### PTS Blocking Criteria

**Any failure in PTS components = IMMEDIATE STOP**

#### Critical Blocking (Stops development)
- **No clear purpose** - Cannot justify the need (Clarity failure)
- **Multiple responsibilities** - Fundamentally violates SRP (Sufficiency failure)  
- **Unnecessary complexity** - Simpler solution exists (Directness failure)
- **Not reusable** - Only useful in specific case (Pragmatism failure)
- **Not maintainable** - Requires specialized knowledge to modify (Technical Excellence failure)

#### Quality Blocking (Requires correction)
- **No direct verification** - Cannot be tested effectively (Precision failure)
- **Complex documentation** - Requires extensive explanation (Clarity failure)
- **Inadequate performance** - Doesn't meet basic requirements (Effectiveness failure)
- **Poor error handling** - Errors not informative or without recovery (Exactitude failure)
- **Breaks conventions** - Inconsistent with ecosystem (Coherence failure)

#### Architecture Blocking
- **No SSOT** - Data duplicated without justification (Structure failure)
- **Forced integration** - No natural fit with system (Coherence failure)
- **Evolution blocked** - Future changes require major refactoring (Pragmatism failure)

## Integration with Existing Principles

### PTS as Meta-principle

**PTS governs all other principles:**

- **SOLID + PTS**: Solid architecture AND pragmatically valuable
- **DRY + PTS**: Eliminate duplication only if it reduces practical complexity  
- **YAGNI + PTS**: Implement only proven pragmatic value
- **Fail Fast + PTS**: Early detection with <5 second error identification

### Enhanced Principle Integration

**PTS modifies SOLID application:**
- **SRP + PTS**: One clear responsibility AND pragmatically useful
- **OCP + PTS**: Extensible in simple and evident way
- **LSP + PTS**: Substitution without additional complexity
- **ISP + PTS**: Specific interfaces AND easy to use
- **DIP + PTS**: Pragmatic abstractions, not theoretical

**PTS modifies other principles:**
- **DRY + PTS**: Don't repeat knowledge, with pragmatism - if eliminating duplication adds significant complexity, evaluate trade-off
- **YAGNI + PTS**: Don't implement until pragmatically valuable - need must be evident and immediate, not speculative

### Absolute Priority

**In principle conflicts: PTS wins always**

1. PTS evaluation first
2. If passes PTS, apply Tier 1-5
3. If conflict between tiers, PTS is final arbiter
4. Document decision with PTS justification

### Conflict Resolution Protocol

**When PTS components conflict with each other:**

1. **Priority Order**:
   1. Effectiveness (must solve real problems)
   2. Directness (must be simplest path)
   3. Precision (must be exact and correct)
   4. Clarity (must be understandable)

2. **Resolution Process**:
   - Identify specific conflict points
   - Apply priority order to determine winner
   - Seek solution that satisfies both when possible
   - Document resolution rationale
