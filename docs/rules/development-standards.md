**Updated**: 2025-07-24 | **Authority**: Partnership Protocol | **Limit**: 100 lines

## PTS Framework (ðŸ›‘ BLOCKING: 12/12 required)
**Technical**: Directness (â‰¤3 steps) | Precision (100%) | Sufficiency (minimal) | Excellence
**Communication**: Exactitude | Sobriety (no marketing) | Structure | Conciseness  
**Cognitive**: Clarity | Coherence | Effectiveness | Pragmatism
**Full Details**: @docs/core/pts-framework.md

## Technical Standards
### Line Limits
Commands: â‰¤150 | Docs: â‰¤200 | **Blocking**: Dev stops if exceeded

### Autocontained Principle
Self-contained | Embedded logic | No external deps | Single responsibility
Commands reference only via /slash calls

## Implementation Rules
### Error Resolution (5-Phase)
Explore â†’ Research â†’ UltraThink x4 â†’ Solve â†’ Log | Visual validation for UI | Root cause focus

### Pattern Storage
Internal timestamps only | Dynamic categorization | Auto-capture | Evolution tracking

### Vision Authority
@docs/vision/ â†’ Core â†’ Implementation | All decisions traceable to vision

## Architecture Standards
**Single Responsibility**: One purpose | Clear boundaries | Focused | Modular
**Orchestration**: Simple blocks â†’ Orchestrators â†’ Complex workflows

## Quality Gates
### Pre-Development
PTS pre-check (2 min) | Vision alignment | Principle compliance | Resource planning

### During Development  
Real-time PTS | Line monitoring | Standards compliance | Integration testing

### Post-Development
Full PTS (12/12) | Integration verified | Docs updated | Patterns captured

## Workflow Integration
### Planning Protocol
Context â†’ Vision â†’ UltraThink x4 â†’ Parallel design â†’ Execute

### Tool Usage
Task Tool priority | Parallel execution | Context economy | @docs/rules/tool-usage-protocols.md

### Documentation
Update CLAUDE.md | Capture learnings | Maintain references | Pattern evolution
