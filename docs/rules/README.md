# Modular Rule System - ce-simple

**Last Updated: 2025-07-23**
**Authority**: Master registry implementing docs/vision/ absolute authority

## Purpose

Master registry and navigation hub for ce-simple modular rule system. Each rule module handles specific aspects of the partnership protocol while maintaining coherent integration.

## Rule Module Architecture

### Core Rule Modules

#### 1. [Partnership Protocol](partnership-protocol.md)
**Scope**: Core partnership definition and role boundaries
- Partnership roles and responsibilities  
- Core mission and objectives
- Success metrics for partnership effectiveness

#### 2. [Communication Rules](communication-rules.md) 
**Scope**: All communication protocols and context management
- Language standards and communication style
- Model selection guidance and transparency requirements
- Question protocols and clarification procedures

#### 3. [Development Standards](development-standards.md)
**Scope**: Technical implementation requirements and quality frameworks
- PTS 12-component framework and quality gates
- Line limits and autocontained principles
- Error resolution and pattern storage protocols

#### 4. [Tool Usage Protocols](tool-usage-protocols.md)
**Scope**: Task Tool optimization and execution patterns
- Parallel execution and wave-based deployment
- Think x4 methodology and context economy
- Token optimization guidelines

#### 5. [Git Workflow Protocols](git-workflow-protocols.md)
**Scope**: Version control excellence and collaborative development
- Claude Code commit protocol and signature requirements
- Git worktree strategy and branch management
- Quality gates and automation integration

#### 6. [Project Governance](project-governance.md)
**Scope**: Structure maintenance and file organization
- Directory authority hierarchy
- File management and command system architecture  
- Structure integrity enforcement

#### 7. [Evolution and Learning](evolution-learning.md)
**Scope**: System growth and continuous improvement
- Rule updating protocols and pattern capture
- Learning integration and system scaling
- Backward compatibility requirements

#### 8. [Documentation Standards](documentation-standards.md)
**Scope**: Writing standards and clarity requirements
- English-only documentation mandate
- Word economy and simplicity principles
- Technical communication standards

#### 9. [Command Structure Standard](command-structure-standard.md)
**Scope**: Command development and formatting requirements
- 4-section command structure pattern
- Length limits and word economy standards
- Natural language execution instructions

#### 10. [Claude MD Import Guide](claude-md-import-guide.md)
**Scope**: CLAUDE.md enhancement and import protocols
- Dynamic content integration procedures
- User-driven improvement capture methods
- Git integration and documentation evolution

## Authority Hierarchy

```
docs/vision/overview.md (Absolute Authority)

Partnership Protocol (Foundation)
    ↓
Specialized Rule Modules (Implementation)
    ↓
System Components (Execution)
```

## Integration Protocols

### Cross-Module Dependencies
- **Partnership Protocol** ← foundational for → **All Modules**
- **Communication Rules** ← integrates with → **Tool Usage Protocols** + **Documentation Standards**
- **Development Standards** ← enforces → **Git Workflow Protocols** + **Project Governance** + **Command Structure Standard**
- **Git Workflow Protocols** ← supports → **Tool Usage Protocols** + **Development Standards** + **Claude MD Import Guide**
- **Documentation Standards** ← enforces → **Command Structure Standard** + **Claude MD Import Guide**
- **Command Structure Standard** ← implements → **Development Standards** + **Documentation Standards**
- **Claude MD Import Guide** ← integrates → **Git Workflow Protocols** + **Documentation Standards**
- **Evolution and Learning** ← captures insights from → **All Modules**

### Conflict Resolution
1. **Vision Authority**: docs/vision/ overrides all rules
2. **Partnership Foundation**: Partnership Protocol mediates module conflicts
3. **Practical Implementation**: Most specific rule takes precedence
4. **Evolution Path**: Conflicts drive rule system evolution

## Rule Application Guidelines

### Development Decisions
1. Check docs/vision/ for alignment
2. Reference Partnership Protocol for role clarity
3. Apply relevant specialized module rules
4. Document decisions for learning capture

### Quality Validation
1. **PTS Compliance**: Development Standards framework
2. **Communication Quality**: Communication Rules validation
3. **Tool Efficiency**: Tool Usage Protocols optimization
4. **Structure Integrity**: Project Governance enforcement

## Continuous Evolution

### Rule Update Protocol
1. **Insight Capture**: Document new learnings from interactions
2. **Module Assignment**: Determine which module needs updates
3. **Integration Testing**: Validate rule changes across modules
4. **Version Control**: Track evolution with timestamp logging

### Pattern Integration
- Success patterns automatically captured in Evolution and Learning
- Rule effectiveness measured against Partnership success metrics
- Cross-module optimizations identified and implemented
- System evolution guided by practical experience

---

**Usage**: Reference appropriate rule modules for specific development contexts. All modules work together to implement the partnership protocol while maintaining alignment with system vision.
