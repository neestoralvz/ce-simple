## Rule Module Registry

### Core Partnership Foundation
1. **[Partnership Protocol](partnership-protocol.md)** - Core partnership definition establishing fundamental working relationship between user and Claude. Defines roles, responsibilities, mission alignment, success metrics, and foundational interaction principles that govern all other rule modules.

### Communication & Language Standards
2. **[Communication Rules](communication-rules.md)** - Communication protocol specifications including English-only mandate, model selection criteria, question protocols, feedback mechanisms, and clarity standards ensuring precise technical communication.

3. **[Documentation Standards](documentation-standards.md)** - Writing standards enforcing English-only content, word economy principles, technical clarity requirements, structure consistency, and documentation quality gates across all system components.

### Technical Development Framework
4. **[Development Standards](development-standards.md)** - Technical implementation requirements including PTS (Pragmatic Technical Simplicity) 12-component framework, line limits (150 commands/200 docs), autocontained principles, and quality validation protocols.

5. **[Tool Usage Protocols](tool-usage-protocols.md)** - Task Tool optimization strategies including parallel execution patterns, Think x4 methodology, token economy management, agent coordination, and workflow efficiency maximization.

6. **[Command Structure Standard](command-structure-standard.md)** - Command formatting specifications including 4-section pattern (Purpose/Usage/Logic/Notes), length limits, natural language requirements, and consistency protocols for all slash commands.

### Project & Process Management
7. **[Git Workflow Protocols](git-workflow-protocols.md)** - Version control standards including commit protocol specifications, worktree strategy implementation, quality gate enforcement, branch management, and integration procedures.

8. **[Project Governance](project-governance.md)** - Structure maintenance protocols including directory hierarchy enforcement, file management standards, integrity validation, organization consistency, and system boundary definitions.

### System Evolution Framework
9. **[Evolution and Learning](evolution-learning.md)** - System growth management including rule update procedures, pattern capture methodologies, scaling requirement assessment, continuous improvement protocols, and adaptation strategies.

10. **[Claude MD Import Guide](claude-md-import-guide.md)** - CLAUDE.md enhancement protocols including dynamic integration procedures, user improvement incorporation, git evolution tracking, and context optimization strategies.

## Authority Hierarchy & Governance

### Authority Chain
**docs/vision/** (Absolute Authority) → **Partnership Protocol** (Foundation) → **Specialized Modules** (Implementation) → **System Components** (Application)

### Authority Scope Definitions
- **docs/vision/**: Technical direction, system philosophy, architectural decisions
- **Partnership Protocol**: Working relationship, core principles, fundamental interactions
- **Communication/Documentation Standards**: Language use, writing quality, format consistency
- **Development/Tool/Command Standards**: Technical implementation, code quality, structure
- **Git/Project Governance**: Process management, organization maintenance, integrity
- **Evolution and Learning**: System adaptation, improvement protocols, scaling strategies

## Cross-Module Dependencies & Integration

### Foundational Dependencies
- **Partnership Protocol** → All Modules (establishes working relationship foundation)
- **docs/vision/** → Partnership Protocol (provides technical direction and philosophy)

### Integration Clusters
**Communication Cluster**: Communication Rules + Documentation Standards + Tool Usage Protocols
- Ensures consistent, efficient, high-quality interaction across all system touchpoints

**Technical Cluster**: Development Standards + Command Structure + Git Workflow
- Maintains technical quality, consistency, and process integrity throughout development

**Management Cluster**: Project Governance + Evolution and Learning + Claude MD Import
- Provides structure maintenance, continuous improvement, and system evolution capabilities

### Dependency Examples
- Development Standards → Git Workflow (PTS compliance affects commit protocols)
- Tool Usage → Communication Rules (parallel execution requires clear delegation)
- Evolution Learning ← All Modules (captures insights from every rule implementation)
- Project Governance → Command Structure (directory organization affects command placement)

## Integration Protocols & Conflict Resolution

### Rule Application Sequence
1. **Vision Alignment**: Verify decision aligns with docs/vision/ technical direction
2. **Partnership Clarity**: Apply Partnership Protocol foundational principles
3. **Module Rules**: Execute relevant specialized module protocols
4. **Cross-Module Integration**: Resolve dependencies and ensure consistency
5. **Learning Capture**: Document patterns and insights for Evolution module

### Conflict Resolution Hierarchy
1. **Vision Authority**: docs/vision/ overrides all other considerations
2. **Partnership Foundation**: Partnership Protocol principles when vision unclear
3. **Most Specific Rule**: More specific module rule takes precedence over general
4. **Evolution Path**: Evolution and Learning module provides adaptation strategy
5. **User Clarification**: Request user guidance when hierarchy insufficient

### Integration Quality Gates
- **Consistency Validation**: No contradictions between applied rules
- **Completeness Check**: All relevant modules consulted for decision
- **Efficiency Assessment**: Solution optimizes across communication, technical, and process requirements
- **Evolution Readiness**: Decision supports system growth and improvement

## Evolution & Update Procedures

### Module Update Protocol
1. **Insight Identification**: Recognize pattern or improvement opportunity
2. **Module Assignment**: Determine which rule module should incorporate insight
3. **Integration Analysis**: Assess impact on dependent and related modules
4. **Testing Implementation**: Validate change doesn't break existing functionality
5. **Version Control**: Update module with proper documentation and cross-references

### System-Wide Evolution
- **Pattern Recognition**: Evolution module captures successful implementation patterns
- **Rule Refinement**: Modules updated based on practical application experience
- **Integration Optimization**: Cross-module dependencies refined for efficiency
- **Scale Adaptation**: Rules evolved to handle growing system complexity

## Navigation & Usage Guidelines

### Quick Reference Navigation
- **New Partnership**: Start with Partnership Protocol + Communication Rules
- **Technical Development**: Development Standards + Tool Usage + Command Structure
- **Process Management**: Git Workflow + Project Governance
- **System Enhancement**: Evolution Learning + Claude MD Import + Documentation Standards

### Module Consultation Protocol
1. **Identify Decision Type**: Determine which aspect of system is affected
2. **Primary Module**: Consult most relevant rule module first
3. **Cross-References**: Check dependent and related modules
4. **Integration Check**: Ensure consistency across all applicable rules
5. **Document Application**: Record rule application for learning capture

### Validation & Application Protocols
- **Rule Compliance**: All decisions must comply with applicable rule modules
- **Documentation**: Rule applications documented for pattern recognition
- **Quality Assurance**: Regular validation of rule effectiveness and consistency
- **Continuous Improvement**: Rules refined based on practical application results
