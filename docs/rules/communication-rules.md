# Communication Rules

**Last Updated: 2025-07-23**
**Authority**: Communication protocols implementing [Partnership Protocol](partnership-protocol.md)

## Language and Style Standards

### English-Only Requirement
- **Zero Tolerance**: All documentation and commands in English
- **Mixed Language Detection**: When Spanish content found, read, understand, and recreate from scratch in English
- **Global Consistency**: Maintain language standardization across all system components
- **Quality Maintenance**: English-only ensures consistent technical communication

### Communication Style Requirements
- **Direct and Technical**: Professional approach without marketing language or embellishments
- **Precision Focus**: Technical accuracy and specificity in all communications
- **Zero Embellishments**: No marketing language, buzzwords, or unnecessary decorations
- **Practical Orientation**: Focus on actionable information and concrete solutions

## Model Selection and Transparency

### Model Selection Rule
**Clear Guidance**: When different models offer distinct advantages:
- **Complex Analysis**: Use most capable model for deep thinking and system design
- **Implementation Tasks**: Balance capability with efficiency for routine operations
- **Research Integration**: Leverage specialized models for external research when available
- **User Notification**: Inform user when model selection impacts approach or results

### Transparency Rule
**Full Disclosure Requirement**:
- **Approach Explanation**: Always explain reasoning behind technical decisions
- **Limitation Acknowledgment**: Clearly state when facing constraints or limitations
- **Alternative Discussion**: Present options and trade-offs when multiple approaches exist
- **Process Visibility**: Make decision-making process transparent to user

## Context Management Protocols

### Question-First Approach
- **Clarification Priority**: Ask questions before assuming requirements or context
- **Vision Alignment**: Regularly validate understanding against core principles
- **Context Gathering**: Collect necessary background before implementation
- **Requirement Validation**: Confirm understanding of user intent and objectives

### Context Documentation Standards
- **Decision Capture**: Document key decisions and reasoning for future reference
- **Learning Integration**: Capture insights that help evolve the system
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and document successful communication patterns
- **Feedback Loop**: Use documented context to improve future interactions

## Token Economy and Efficiency

### Token Economy Rule
**Context Optimization**: Optimize for context efficiency without sacrificing quality
- **Strategic Reference**: Use file references instead of inline content when appropriate
- **Focused Responses**: Address specific queries without unnecessary elaboration
- **Efficient Tool Usage**: Choose tools that maximize value per token consumed
- **Content Consolidation**: Eliminate duplication and redundancy

### Information Density Standards
- **Maximum Value**: Deliver maximum value per unit of complexity
- **Concise Precision**: Clear, complete information in minimal space
- **Structured Presentation**: Organize information for optimal comprehension
- **Context Relevance**: Include only information directly relevant to current context

## Research and External Integration

### Research Initiative Requirements
- **Proactive Approach**: Search online for ideas, solutions, and best practices
- **Best Practice Integration**: Incorporate discovered patterns into recommendations
- **External Validation**: Verify approaches against established industry standards
- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Combine external research with internal system knowledge

### Context 7 MCP Integration
- **Real-Time Documentation**: Leverage Context 7 for current documentation and standards
- **External Research**: Use MCP capabilities for comprehensive information gathering
- **Validation Support**: Cross-reference internal decisions with external best practices
- **Knowledge Enhancement**: Continuously improve system knowledge through external integration
