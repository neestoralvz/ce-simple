# Targeted Web Research for Problem-Solving

## 🎯 Enhanced Search Strategy Framework

### Problem-Specific Search Intelligence

#### Smart Query Generation Algorithm
**Context-Aware Search Formation**:
```
Error Message + Technology Stack + Problem Domain + Solution Context
```

**Query Enhancement Patterns**:
- **Exact Error**: "[exact error message]" + framework + version
- **Solution Focus**: "how to fix [problem type]" + technology + best practices  
- **Community Insight**: "[error]" + site:stackoverflow.com OR site:github.com
- **Documentation Deep**: "[framework] [error type]" + site:official-docs.com
- **Recent Solutions**: "[error]" after:2023 + framework + implementation
- **Alternative Approaches**: "[problem domain]" + workaround + alternative + solution

#### Multi-Strategy Search Deployment
**Parallel Search Execution**:

**Strategy 1: Direct Error Resolution**
```
🎯 PRIMARY: "[exact_error_message]" + [technology_stack]
🔧 SOLUTION: "fix [error_type]" + [framework] + [version]  
⚡ QUICK: [error_keyword] + solved + working + example
```

**Strategy 2: Technology-Specific Investigation**  
```
📚 DOCS: [framework] + [error_category] + official + documentation
🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION: [technology] + [problem_domain] + best practices + 2024
🔍 DEEP-DIVE: [framework] + internals + [error_component] + explanation
```

**Strategy 3: Community Intelligence**
```
🌐 STACKOVERFLOW: "[error]" site:stackoverflow.com + accepted answer
💬 GITHUB: "[error]" site:github.com + issues + closed + solution  
📖 REDDIT: "[technology]" + "[problem]" site:reddit.com + solved
```

**Strategy 4: Pattern Recognition**
```
🔄 SIMILAR: similar issues + [technology] + [error_pattern]
📊 TRENDS: [error_type] + common causes + [framework] + debugging
🧪 TESTING: reproduce + [error] + [technology] + test case + example
```

### Enhanced `/explore-web` Integration

#### Problem-Solving Mode Enhancement
**Specialized Search Execution** (when called from `/problem-solving`):

```
⚡ MULTI-STRATEGY DEPLOYMENT: Execute 4 parallel search strategies
🎯 RELEVANCE FILTERING: Prioritize recent, official, and highly-rated sources
🔧 SOLUTION EXTRACTION: Focus on actionable fixes over theoretical explanations  
📊 PATTERN CONSOLIDATION: Identify recurring solutions and approaches across sources
```

#### Intelligent Query Refinement
**Adaptive Search Logic**:
- **Initial Results Poor**: Broaden search terms, remove version constraints
- **Too Many Generic Results**: Add specific context, narrow to exact error
- **No Recent Results**: Remove time constraints, search historical solutions
- **Framework-Specific**: Add language-specific qualifiers and community sites

#### Result Quality Enhancement
**Source Prioritization Framework**:
```
TIER 1 (Authority): Official documentation, framework maintainers, established experts
TIER 2 (Community): Stack Overflow accepted answers, GitHub issue resolutions  
TIER 3 (Discussion): Reddit solutions, blog posts with implementation examples
TIER 4 (Exploration): General discussions, theoretical explanations, academic sources
```

**Content Extraction Optimization**:
- **Solution Code**: Extract specific code examples and implementation snippets
- **Configuration Fix**: Identify configuration changes and setup requirements
- **Dependency Updates**: Version compatibility and upgrade requirements
- **Environment Setup**: Platform-specific considerations and dependencies

### Problem-Specific Search Templates

#### Error Classification Templates

**Code Errors**:
```
🐛 SYNTAX: "[exact_syntax_error]" + [language] + fix + example
🔧 LOGIC: "[behavior_description]" + [language] + debug + solution + working
⚡ RUNTIME: "[exception_type]" + [framework] + cause + fix + prevention
```

**Configuration Errors**:
```
⚙️ SETUP: "[config_error]" + [tool/framework] + configuration + correct + example  
📁 PATH: "[path_error]" + [operating_system] + setup + fix + working
🔐 PERMISSION: "[permission_error]" + [platform] + fix + solution + chmod + access
```

**Integration Errors**:
```
🔗 API: "[api_error]" + [service] + integration + fix + working + example
📡 NETWORK: "[network_error]" + [protocol] + configuration + solution + debug
🗄️ DATABASE: "[db_error]" + [database_type] + connection + fix + configuration
```

**Performance Errors**:
```
⚡ SPEED: "[performance_issue]" + [technology] + optimization + best practices + faster
📈 MEMORY: "[memory_error]" + [language] + optimization + fix + allocation + efficient  
🔄 CONCURRENCY: "[concurrency_issue]" + [framework] + threading + async + solution
```

### Search Result Processing Framework

#### Content Analysis Pipeline
**Information Extraction**:
1. **Solution Identification**: Extract specific fixes, code changes, configuration updates
2. **Validation Approach**: Identify how to test/verify the proposed solution
3. **Risk Assessment**: Understand potential side effects or system impacts  
4. **Implementation Steps**: Sequence of actions required for solution application
5. **Prevention Strategy**: Methods to avoid similar issues in the future

#### Knowledge Synthesis
**Multi-Source Consolidation**:
- **Consensus Building**: Identify solutions mentioned across multiple high-quality sources
- **Context Adaptation**: Adapt generic solutions to specific problem context
- **Best Practice Integration**: Combine immediate fixes with long-term improvements
- **Alternative Evaluation**: Present multiple solution approaches with trade-offs

### Integration with Problem-Solving Workflow

#### Phase 3 Enhancement (External Knowledge Research)
**Enhanced Execution Flow**:
```
1. CONTEXT ANALYSIS: Extract error details, technology stack, environment info
2. QUERY GENERATION: Create 4 parallel search strategies with refined queries  
3. MULTI-SEARCH EXECUTION: Deploy targeted searches using enhanced /explore-web
4. RESULT PROCESSING: Apply quality filtering, solution extraction, pattern analysis
5. KNOWLEDGE SYNTHESIS: Consolidate findings into actionable intelligence for think-layers
```

#### Output Enhancement
