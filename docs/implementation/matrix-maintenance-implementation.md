## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Maintenance Protocol Framework

#### Core Architecture
```
Scan → Analyze → Matrix → Validate → Optimize → Monitor
```

**Scanning Engine**
- **File System Crawler**: Recursive directory traversal with intelligent filtering
- **Dependency Parser**: Multi-language dependency extraction (JS/TS, Python, Go, Rust, Java)
- **Cross-Reference Detector**: Link validation across markdown, code comments, and documentation
- **Change Detection**: Git-based modification tracking with timestamp correlation
- **Performance Target**: <500ms for codebases up to 10k files

#### Scanning Algorithms

**Dependency Detection Methods**
```
1. Static Analysis Pipeline:
   - AST parsing for import/export relationships
   - Package.json/requirements.txt/go.mod analysis
   - Dockerfile and docker-compose dependency extraction
   - CI/CD pipeline dependency mapping

2. Dynamic Reference Scanning:
   - Markdown link validation (relative/absolute paths)
   - Code comment reference verification
   - Documentation cross-reference integrity
   - Command system interdependency mapping

3. Semantic Analysis:
   - Function/class usage patterns
   - API endpoint relationships
   - Database schema dependencies
   - Configuration file relationships
```

**Algorithm Performance Metrics**
- **Accuracy Target**: >95% dependency detection rate
- **False Positive Rate**: <3%
- **Processing Speed**: 1000 files/second on standard hardware
- **Memory Efficiency**: <100MB for 50k file projects

### Matrix Generation Procedures

#### FMEA Integration Protocol
```
Risk Assessment Matrix:
Severity × Probability × Detection = Risk Priority Number (RPN)

Severity Scale (1-10):
1-3: Minor impact (documentation gaps)
4-6: Moderate impact (functionality degradation)
7-8: Major impact (system instability)
9-10: Critical impact (system failure)

Probability Scale (1-10):
1-3: Rare occurrence
4-6: Occasional occurrence
7-8: Frequent occurrence
9-10: Almost certain

Detection Scale (1-10):
1-3: Almost certain detection
4-6: High detection likelihood
7-8: Moderate detection likelihood
9-10: Detection unlikely
```

```

### Validation Protocols

#### Quantitative Thresholds
```
Health Score Calculation:
Base Score = 100

Deductions:
- Broken dependencies: -5 points each
- Missing cross-references: -3 points each
- Orphaned files: -2 points each
- Circular dependencies: -10 points each
- Outdated documentation: -1 point each

Thresholds:
- Excellent (95-100): Green status
- Good (85-94): Yellow status  
- Poor (70-84): Orange status
- Critical (<70): Red status - Auto-trigger maintenance
```

#### Validation Procedures
1. **Dependency Integrity Check**
   - Verify all imports resolve correctly
   - Validate package versions and compatibility
   - Check for security vulnerabilities in dependencies

2. **Cross-Reference Validation**
   - Verify all markdown links are accessible
   - Validate code comment references
   - Check documentation-to-code alignment

3. **Structural Integrity Assessment**
   - Identify circular dependencies
   - Detect orphaned files and modules
   - Validate architectural compliance

### Auto-Trigger Mechanisms

#### Integration Points
```
Trigger Conditions:
1. Git Hook Integration:
   - Pre-commit: Dependency validation
   - Post-merge: Full matrix regeneration
   - Pre-push: Health score verification

2. CI/CD Integration:
   - Build pipeline: Matrix health check
   - Deployment gate: Critical dependency validation
   - Scheduled runs: Daily maintenance scans

3. Command Integration:
   - /docs-workflow: Auto-trigger on documentation changes
   - /explore-codebase: Matrix update after discovery
   - /start: Health check during initialization

4. Threshold-Based Triggers:
   - Health score drops below 85: Warning notification
   - Health score drops below 70: Auto-maintenance trigger
   - Critical dependency failures: Immediate escalation
```

#### Notification Protocol
```
Severity Levels:
- INFO: Routine maintenance completed
- WARN: Health score degradation detected
- ERROR: Critical dependencies broken
- CRITICAL: System integrity compromised

Notification Channels:
- Console output with color coding
- Git commit messages with health metrics
- CI/CD pipeline status updates
- Optional: Slack/email integration hooks
```
