# Docs Generate Implementation Details

## 3-Wave Execution Strategy

### Wave 1: Parallel Document Creation
**AGENT DEPLOYMENT**:
- Parse todo plans → Identify document requirements
- Deploy specialized agents per document (parallel execution)
- Apply template standards during creation
- Validate basic structure compliance

**Progress Tracking**:
```
📝 WAVE-1: Deploying [N] document agents → Parallel creation initiated
📄 PROGRESS: Document [X]/[N] completed → Template compliance verified
🔧 AGENT-[ID]: [Document] created → [Lines] lines, structure validated
```

### Wave 2: Cross-Reference Integration
**REFERENCE BUILDING**:
- Analyze document relationships → Identify connection points
- Generate bidirectional cross-reference network
- Apply standard "See Also" format
- Validate reference completeness

**Integration Logic**:
```
🔗 WAVE-2: Cross-reference analysis → [N] connection points identified
📊 LINKING: [X] references created → Bidirectional network established
✅ VALIDATION: [Y]% reference coverage → Navigation depth verified
```

### Wave 3: Quality Validation
**VALIDATION SEQUENCE**:
- Execute structural compliance checks
- Apply quantitative metrics assessment
- Trigger `/docs-audit` for comprehensive analysis
- Generate quality report with actionable recommendations

**Quality Gates**:
```
✅ WAVE-3: Quality validation initiated → Multi-layer assessment
📊 METRICS: [Structure/Content/References] → Combined score calculation
🔍 AUDIT: Comprehensive analysis → Health score: [X]/100
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Validation Failure Protocol
**FAILURE DETECTION**:
- Quality score < 85% threshold
- Critical structural violations
- Reference integrity issues
- Template non-compliance

**RECOVERY ACTIONS**:
```
⚠️ ISSUES: Quality threshold not met → Score: [X]% (target: 85%)
🔄 CORRECTION: Deploying targeted agents → Focus: [specific issues]
🎯 RETRY: Corrective actions completed → Re-validation triggered
```

## Git Integration Protocol

**SESSION-COMPLETION Tracking**: Uses standardized git integration templates for consistent commit generation

**Reference**: See `../../docs/workflow/git-integration.md` for complete commit templates and usage guidelines

## Integration Points

### Todo List Processing
**PLAN EXTRACTION**:
- Scan current todo lists for documentation plans
- Parse document requirements and specifications
- Validate plan completeness before execution
- Generate execution roadmap with agent allocation

### Standards Compliance
**TEMPLATE APPLICATION**:
- Apply command template structure to generated documents
- Enforce writing standards (≤200 lines, density optimization)
- Implement anti-bias protocols (evidence-based content)
- Validate cross-reference integration patterns
