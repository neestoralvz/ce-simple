# EXCELLENT STP Example from init-project.md:

## Purpose (STP Clarity + Exactitude)
Initialize ce-simple project with git repository, directory structure, and core documentation.

## Principles (STP Structure + Technical Excellence)
- **Single Responsibility**: Project initialization only
- **Directness**: Three sequential phases without indirection
- **Technical Precision**: Specific git, directory, and file operations
- **Error Recovery**: Clear fallbacks with actionable guidance

## Phase 1: Git Repository Setup (STP Directness + Precision)
Use Bash to setup git:
```bash
git init
git config --local user.name "Developer"
git config --local user.email "dev@project.local"
```

If git initialization fails:
- Continue without git (project structure remains functional)
- Output: "Git unavailable - manual setup required: `git init` in project root"

✅ Analysis: Perfect STP compliance
- Directness: Direct git commands, no indirection
- Precision: Exact commands with specific parameters
- Sufficiency: Complete setup instructions
- Error Recovery: Specific fallback with exact manual steps
```

### Example 2: `start.md` - Context Analysis Excellence

#### STP + Tier 1 Excellence:
```yaml
Purpose: "Analyzes current project context and provides actionable development recommendations"

STP Highlights:
  - Directness: Context scan → Analysis → Recommendations (3 direct steps)
  - Precision: Systematic assessment with specific outputs
  - Clarity: Clear analysis purpose, immediate comprehension
  - Pragmatism: Provides actionable next steps

SOLID Implementation:
  - SRP: Analysis and guidance only (single responsibility)
  - OCP: Extensible to advanced/analyze-deep.md
  - DIP: References docs/core/ for principles

Code Quality Example:
  - Clean separation of analysis phases
  - Specific error handling for assessment failures
  - Clear fallback strategies
  - Actionable recommendation delivery
```

### Example 3: `explore-codebase.md` - Structure Analysis Model

#### STP + Architecture Integration:
```yaml
Purpose: "Analyze project structure, identify coding patterns, and document architectural insights"

STP Excellence:
  - Technical Excellence: Sophisticated analysis with simple interface
  - Structure: Logical progression (Structure→Patterns→Documentation)
  - Effectiveness: Produces actionable architectural insights
  - Pragmatism: Real-world codebase analysis utility

Advanced Features with STP Compliance:
  - Pattern recognition maintains simplicity
  - Architecture documentation stays clear
  - Technical insights remain accessible
  - Error handling with scope reduction
```

## Tier 2: Critical Principle Examples

### Separation of Concerns Implementation:

#### Perfect Separation in Current Commands:
```yaml
init-project.md:
  ✅ Concern: Project initialization only
  ✅ Boundary: No development, analysis, or exploration
  ✅ Interface: Clear initialization scope

start.md:
  ✅ Concern: Context analysis and guidance only  
  ✅ Boundary: No initialization, exploration, or implementation
  ✅ Interface: Clear analysis and recommendation scope

explore-codebase.md:
  ✅ Concern: Codebase analysis and documentation only
  ✅ Boundary: No modification, initialization, or implementation
  ✅ Interface: Clear exploration and insight scope

Separation Quality: Perfect domain separation with no concern mixing
```

### Fail Fast Implementation:

#### Excellent Error Handling Examples:
```yaml
From init-project.md:
  Error Scenario: Git initialization fails
  Fail Fast Response:
    - Immediate detection: Git command failure caught
    - Clear guidance: "Git unavailable - manual setup required"
    - Specific action: "`git init` in project root"
    - Graceful continuation: "project structure remains functional"
  
  STP Compliance:
    ✅ Directness: Immediate error detection and response
    ✅ Precision: Specific error cause and resolution
    ✅ Clarity: Clear error message and recovery path
    ✅ Pragmatism: Practical fallback that maintains functionality

From explore-codebase.md:
  Error Scenario: Directory access fails
  Fail Fast Response:
    - Immediate scope adjustment: "Fallback to current working directory only"
    - Clear limitation reporting: "Report permission limitations"
    - Continued operation: "Continue with available scope"
  
  Fail Fast Excellence: 
    ✅ Early detection without system-wide failure
    ✅ Clear limitation communication
    ✅ Practical continuation strategy
```

### Convention over Configuration:

#### Default Behavior Examples:
```yaml
init-project.md Conventions:
  ✅ Standard git configuration (user.name, user.email)
  ✅ Standard directory structure (commands/, docs/core/, docs/vision/, archive/)
  ✅ Standard documentation files (CLAUDE.md, README.md)
  ✅ No configuration required - works immediately

start.md Conventions:
  ✅ Standard analysis workflow (scan → analyze → recommend)
  ✅ Standard output format (analysis + actionable recommendations)
  ✅ No configuration required for basic analysis

Convention Quality: 
  - 100% operations work with sensible defaults
  - 0 required configuration for basic functionality
  - Immediate productivity without setup
```

### Least Surprise Implementation:

#### Predictable Behavior Examples:
```yaml
Command Name Predictability:
  ✅ init-project: Obviously initializes projects
  ✅ start: Obviously provides starting guidance
  ✅ explore-codebase: Obviously explores and analyzes code

Behavior Predictability:
  ✅ init-project creates what name suggests (project initialization)
  ✅ start provides what name suggests (starting guidance)
  ✅ explore-codebase does what name suggests (codebase exploration)

Output Predictability:
  ✅ init-project: Functional project structure
  ✅ start: Analysis results + specific recommendations
  ✅ explore-codebase: Codebase analysis report + insights

Surprise Index: 0% - No unexpected behaviors detected
```
