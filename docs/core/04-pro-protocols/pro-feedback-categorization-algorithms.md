**Lines**: ≤200

## Core Classification Engine

### Text Preprocessing Pipeline
```
Input: Raw feedback text
1. Normalize case (convert to lowercase)
2. Remove punctuation and special characters  
3. Tokenize into words and phrases
4. Remove stop words (common words with no semantic value)
5. Stem/lemmatize words to root forms
6. Extract n-grams (1-3 word combinations)
Output: Processed token array
```

### Pattern Matching Algorithm
```
For each category (logros, desafios, errores, obstaculos, aprendizajes):
1. Initialize category score = 0.0
2. For each processed token:
   - Match against category keyword patterns
   - Add weighted score based on keyword importance
   - Apply context multipliers for surrounding words
3. Calculate category confidence = score / total_tokens
4. Apply confidence threshold (0.6 default)
5. Return category confidence scores
```

### Multi-Category Decision Logic
```
1. Run pattern matching for all five categories
2. Collect confidence scores: [logros: 0.8, errores: 0.7, ...]
3. Sort categories by confidence score (descending)
4. Primary category = highest confidence (if >0.6)
5. Secondary categories = additional scores >0.6
6. Flag for manual review if max confidence <0.6
```

## Advanced Pattern Recognition

### Keyword Pattern Libraries

**logros** (Achievement Patterns):
- Direct: ["completed", "successful", "achieved", "accomplished", "delivered"]
- Comparative: ["improved", "optimized", "enhanced", "increased", "better"]
- Quantitative: ["100%", "finished", "deployed", "live", "working"]
- Emotional: ["satisfied", "pleased", "happy", "excited", "proud"]

**desafios** (Challenge Patterns):
- Opportunity: ["opportunity", "potential", "could", "might", "possible"]
- Growth: ["challenge", "learn", "develop", "improve", "enhance"]
- Future: ["next", "future", "upcoming", "planned", "roadmap"]
- Conditional: ["if", "when", "should", "would", "consider"]

**errores** (Error Patterns):
- Direct: ["error", "bug", "mistake", "wrong", "incorrect", "failed"]
- Negative: ["broken", "not working", "doesn't", "can't", "unable"]
- Problems: ["issue", "problem", "trouble", "difficulty", "fault"]
- Quality: ["regression", "degradation", "worse", "slower", "unstable"]

**obstaculos** (Obstacle Patterns):
- Blocking: ["blocked", "stuck", "can't", "unable", "impossible"]
- Limitations: ["limited", "constraint", "restriction", "bottleneck"]
- Dependencies: ["waiting", "depends", "requires", "needs", "blocked by"]
- Resources: ["lack", "missing", "insufficient", "shortage", "unavailable"]

**aprendizajes** (Learning Patterns):
- Discovery: ["learned", "discovered", "realized", "found", "noticed"]
- Understanding: ["understand", "insight", "pattern", "principle", "concept"]
- Knowledge: ["know", "aware", "recognize", "identify", "observe"]
- Wisdom: ["best practice", "lesson", "experience", "understanding"]

### Context-Aware Enhancement
```
1. Sentence Boundary Detection: Analyze feedback in sentence units
2. Proximity Scoring: Keywords near each other reinforce classification
3. Negation Detection: "not successful" reduces logros score
4. Temporal Indicators: "will improve" vs "improved" affects classification
5. Intensity Modifiers: "very successful" increases confidence
```

### Learning and Adaptation
```
1. Historical Analysis: Track classification accuracy over time
2. User Feedback Integration: Learn from manual corrections
3. Pattern Evolution: Discover new keywords through usage analysis
4. Domain Adaptation: Adjust patterns for specific project contexts
5. Confidence Calibration: Optimize thresholds based on performance
```

## Classification Confidence Metrics

### Confidence Calculation Formula
```
confidence = (keyword_score + context_score + pattern_score) / normalization_factor

Where:
- keyword_score = sum of matched keyword weights
- context_score = bonus for supportive surrounding context
- pattern_score = bonus for recognized phrase patterns
- normalization_factor = total tokens analyzed
```

### Quality Assurance Thresholds
- **High Confidence** (0.8-1.0): Automatic classification
- **Medium Confidence** (0.6-0.7): Automatic with review flag
- **Low Confidence** (0.4-0.5): Manual review required
- **Very Low Confidence** (0.0-0.3): Uncategorized, manual assignment

### Multi-Category Handling
```
1. Primary Category: Highest confidence score
2. Secondary Categories: Additional scores >0.6
3. Category Overlap: Common for complex feedback
4. Conflict Resolution: Use category priority weights
5. Manual Override: Always available for edge cases
```

## Real-Time Processing Architecture

### Processing Pipeline Stages
```
1. Input Validation: Verify feedback format and content
2. Text Preprocessing: Clean and tokenize feedback text
3. Pattern Recognition: Apply classification algorithms
4. Confidence Assessment: Calculate and validate scores
5. Category Assignment: Determine primary/secondary categories
6. Output Generation: Structured categorization results
```

### Performance Optimization
- **Parallel Processing**: Analyze multiple feedback items simultaneously
- **Caching**: Store preprocessed patterns for faster matching
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar feedback for efficiency
- **Incremental Learning**: Update patterns without full retraining

### Error Handling and Fallbacks
```
1. Invalid Input: Return error with specific guidance
2. Low Confidence: Flag for manual review with suggestions
3. System Errors: Graceful degradation to manual classification
4. Performance Issues: Queue for later processing
5. Algorithm Updates: Version control for classification logic
```
