## Intelligent Priority Management

### Multi-Factor Priority Scoring
```
Priority Calculation Algorithm:
priority_score = (
    urgency_factor * 0.4 +
    impact_scope * 0.3 +
    user_frequency * 0.2 +
    resolution_complexity * 0.1
)

urgency_factor:
- errores: 0.9-1.0 (immediate attention required)
- obstaculos: 0.7-0.9 (blocking progress)
- desafios: 0.4-0.7 (improvement opportunities)
- logros: 0.2-0.5 (optimization opportunities)
- aprendizajes: 0.3-0.6 (strategic value)

impact_scope:
- system_wide: 1.0 (affects all users and workflows)
- project_wide: 0.8 (affects current project workflows)
- individual_workflow: 0.6 (affects specific user workflows)
- feature_specific: 0.4 (affects specific functionality)
- cosmetic: 0.2 (affects user experience minimally)

user_frequency:
- multiple_users_reporting: 1.0
- single_user_recurring: 0.8
- single_user_frequent: 0.6
- occasional_occurrence: 0.4
- rare_occurrence: 0.2
```

### Resource Allocation Automation
```

1. Technical Issues (errores/obstaculos):
   - Auto-assign to development team based on issue type
   - Generate technical specification and requirement documentation
   - Create testing and validation protocol requirements
   - Establish timeline and milestone tracking

2. Enhancement Opportunities (desafios/logros):
   - Auto-add to product roadmap with priority scoring
   - Generate resource requirement and skill assessment
   - Create user impact analysis and benefit projection
