## Pipeline Architecture Overview

### Stream Processing Framework
```
Input Stream → Preprocessing → Classification → Priority Assessment → Action Generation → Output Integration
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓                   ↓                ↓
  Raw Feedback → Tokenization → Category Scores → Urgency Detection → Recommendations → Sacred Space
```

### Parallel Processing Stages

**Stage 1: Input Validation and Preprocessing** (Parallel Capacity: 8-16 streams)
```
1. Input Format Validation: Verify feedback structure and content quality
2. Duplicate Detection: Identify and handle repeated feedback submissions
3. Text Normalization: Standardize encoding, language, and format
4. Metadata Extraction: Capture timestamp, user context, session information
5. Quality Assessment: Filter out invalid or insufficient feedback
```

**Stage 2: Multi-Category Classification** (Parallel Capacity: 5-10 classifiers)
```
1. Parallel Category Analysis: Run all 5 categories simultaneously via Task Tool
2. Pattern Recognition: Apply embedded keyword and context algorithms
3. Confidence Calculation: Assess classification confidence for each category  
4. Multi-Category Detection: Identify feedback spanning multiple categories
5. Classification Validation: Verify algorithm consistency and accuracy
```

**Stage 3: Priority and Correlation Processing** (Parallel Capacity: 4-8 analyzers)
```
1. Priority Score Calculation: Apply dynamic priority scoring algorithms
2. Urgency Detection: Identify critical feedback requiring immediate attention
3. Correlation Analysis: Check relationships with recent feedback patterns
4. Historical Pattern Matching: Compare against known feedback patterns
5. Cross-Category Relationship Assessment: Analyze category interaction patterns
```

### Streaming Classification Engine
```python
# Real-Time Classification Pipeline
class RealtimeCategorizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.classification_cache = {}
        self.pattern_cache = {}
        self.performance_metrics = {}
    
    def process_feedback_stream(self, feedback_item):
        # Stage 1: Parallel Preprocessing
        preprocessed = self.preprocess_parallel(feedback_item)
        
        # Stage 2: Parallel Classification  
        category_scores = self.classify_parallel(preprocessed)
        
        # Stage 3: Parallel Priority Assessment
        priority_analysis = self.assess_priority_parallel(category_scores, preprocessed)
        
        # Stage 4: Action Generation
        actions = self.generate_actions_parallel(category_scores, priority_analysis)
        
        return {
            'classification': category_scores,
            'priority': priority_analysis, 
            'actions': actions,
            'processing_time': self.measure_performance()
        }
    
    def preprocess_parallel(self, feedback):
        # Deploy 3-4 parallel preprocessing agents via Task Tool
        agents = [
            'text_normalization_agent',
            'metadata_extraction_agent', 
            'quality_assessment_agent',
            'duplicate_detection_agent'
        ]
        return self.execute_parallel_agents(agents, feedback)
    
    def classify_parallel(self, preprocessed_feedback):
        # Deploy 5 parallel classification agents (one per category)
        category_agents = [
            'logros_classifier_agent',
            'desafios_classifier_agent',
            'errores_classifier_agent', 
            'obstaculos_classifier_agent',
            'aprendizajes_classifier_agent'
        ]
        return self.execute_parallel_agents(category_agents, preprocessed_feedback)
```

### Performance Optimization Strategies

**Caching and Memoization**:
```
1. Pattern Cache: Store frequently used classification patterns
2. Result Cache: Cache recent classification results for similar feedback
3. User Pattern Cache: Learn individual user feedback patterns for optimization
4. Category Weight Cache: Store optimized category weights by context
```

**Intelligent Load Balancing**:
```
1. Queue Management: Distribute feedback across available processing agents
2. Resource Monitoring: Track agent performance and availability
3. Dynamic Scaling: Adjust parallel agent count based on feedback volume
4. Priority Queue: Process high-priority feedback with dedicated resources
```

**Real-Time Performance Monitoring**:
```
1. Processing Time Tracking: Monitor pipeline stage execution times
2. Throughput Measurement: Track feedback items processed per second
3. Accuracy Monitoring: Real-time classification accuracy assessment
4. Resource Utilization: Monitor CPU, memory, and agent utilization
```

## Integration Architecture

### Sacred User Space Integration Pipeline
```
1. Feedback Capture: Preserve original user feedback in user-input/context/
2. Classification Overlay: Add categorization without modifying original content
3. Metadata Preservation: Maintain all user context and session information
4. Authenticity Verification: Ensure user voice preservation throughout processing
```

### Action Integration Pipeline  
```
1. Priority-Based Routing: Route high-priority feedback to immediate action queues
2. Category-Specific Handlers: Direct feedback to appropriate action generation systems
3. Cross-Category Coordination: Handle feedback affecting multiple categories
4. Escalation Protocols: Trigger appropriate escalation for critical feedback
```

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Real-Time Input → Processing Pipeline → Classification Results → Action Generation
      ↓                    ↓                     ↓                    ↓
User Feedback → Parallel Analysis → Category Assignment → Recommended Actions
      ↓                    ↓                     ↓                    ↓
Sacred Space → Performance Metrics → Correlation Updates → Tracking Systems
```

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Pipeline Fault Tolerance
```
1. Stage-Level Recovery: Restart failed pipeline stages without losing data
2. Agent Failure Handling: Redistribute work when parallel agents fail
3. Data Integrity Protection: Ensure no feedback loss during processing failures
4. Graceful Degradation: Reduce functionality rather than complete failure
```

### Quality Assurance Integration
```
1. Real-Time Accuracy Monitoring: Track classification accuracy continuously
2. Confidence Threshold Management: Adjust thresholds based on performance
3. Manual Review Triggering: Flag low-confidence classifications for review
4. Feedback Loop Integration: Incorporate manual corrections into algorithm improvement
```

### Performance SLA Management
```
Processing Time Targets:
- Single Feedback Item: <500ms average processing time
- Parallel Processing: 8-16 concurrent items without degradation
- High-Priority Items: <200ms processing time for critical feedback
- Batch Processing: 100+ items per minute sustained throughput

Availability Targets:
- Pipeline Uptime: 99.9% availability during operational hours
- Recovery Time: <30 seconds for pipeline restart after failure
- Data Loss Prevention: Zero feedback loss during normal operations
```

## Monitoring and Analytics Integration

### Real-Time Dashboard Integration
```
1. Live Processing Metrics: Current throughput and processing times
2. Classification Distribution: Real-time category distribution visualization
3. Priority Heatmap: Visual representation of priority distribution
4. Performance Trends: Historical performance trend analysis
```

### Alert and Notification Systems
```
1. Performance Degradation Alerts: Notifications when processing slows
2. High-Priority Feedback Alerts: Immediate notifications for critical feedback
3. System Health Monitoring: Alerts for pipeline component failures
4. Accuracy Threshold Alerts: Notifications when classification accuracy drops
```
