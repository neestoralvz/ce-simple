# Tier 0 - Pragmatic Technical Simplicity (STP)

**Updated**: 2025-07-24 12:54 (Mexico City)  
**Authority Level: Tier 0 - Absolute Foundation**  
**Status: Governing Framework for All Development**

## Framework Overview

**Pragmatic Technical Simplicity (STP)** is the absolute governing principle that rules all 20 existing principles in the 5-tier system. It ensures that every technical decision prioritizes measurable simplicity while maintaining effectiveness.

**Core Principle**: Every component, command, and decision must be the simplest possible solution that achieves the required outcome with measurable technical excellence.

## STP Definition & 12 Components

### Cluster 1: Technical Precision

#### 1. Directness (Directitud)
**Definition**: Shortest path from intention to implementation without intermediate abstractions.

**ce-simple Application**:
- Commands execute workflows directly without unnecessary orchestration layers
- File paths are absolute, not relative: `/Users/nalve/ce-simple/docs/core/` vs `../docs/core/`
- Single-step solutions over multi-step workarounds

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Solution has ≤ 3 intermediate steps between user intent and execution
- [ ] No abstractions exist that could be eliminated without loss of function
- [ ] Command execution path is linear and predictable

**Quantitative Metric**: Execution steps from user input to first useful output ≤ 3

**Example**: `init-project.md` directly creates git repo + structure + docs without intermediate configuration steps

#### 2. Precision (Precisión)
**Definition**: Exact specification with zero ambiguity in technical implementation.

**ce-simple Application**:
- Commands specify exact file paths: `/Users/nalve/ce-simple/commands/init-project.md`
- Error messages provide specific resolution steps, not generic guidance
- Dependencies explicitly stated with version requirements

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] All file references are absolute paths
- [ ] Error conditions have specific resolution steps
- [ ] Dependencies specify exact versions or compatibility ranges

**Quantitative Metric**: 100% of file paths are absolute, 100% of errors have specific resolution steps

**Example**: Instead of "fix git issues", specify "run `git config user.name 'Your Name'` if git user not configured"

#### 3. Sufficiency (Suficiencia)
**Definition**: Complete solution that requires no external additions for core functionality.

**ce-simple Application**:
- Commands contain all necessary context and logic internally
- Documentation provides complete information without external references
- Templates include all required components for immediate use

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Command executes successfully without external dependencies beyond stated requirements
- [ ] All referenced patterns and templates are included or clearly accessible
- [ ] User can achieve stated outcome without additional research

**Quantitative Metric**: 100% success rate for new users following documentation exactly

**Example**: `init-project.md` includes all git setup, directory creation, and documentation generation logic

#### 4. Technical Excellence (Excelencia Técnica)
**Definition**: Implementation demonstrates mastery of technical principles without unnecessary complexity.

**ce-simple Application**:
- Code follows SOLID principles but remains readable
- Architecture leverages appropriate patterns without over-engineering
