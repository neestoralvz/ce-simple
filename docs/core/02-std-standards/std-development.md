# Development Standards with Implementation Verification

**Updated**: 2025-07-26 | **Authority**: Partnership Protocol + User Implementation Verification | **Limit**: 100 lines

## PTS Framework (ðŸ›‘ BLOCKING: 12/12 required)
**Technical**: Directness (â‰¤3 steps) | Precision (100%) | Sufficiency (minimal) | Excellence
**Communication**: Exactitude | Sobriety (no marketing) | Structure | Conciseness  
**Cognitive**: Clarity | Coherence | Effectiveness | Pragmatism
**Full Details**: @docs/core/pts-framework.md

## Technical Standards
### Line Limits
Commands: â‰¤80 | Docs: â‰¤100 | **Blocking**: Dev stops if exceeded

### Autocontained Principle
Self-contained | Embedded logic | No external deps | Single responsibility
Commands reference only via /slash calls

## Implementation Rules
### Error Resolution (5-Phase)
Explore â†’ Research â†’ UltraThink x4 â†’ Solve â†’ Log | Visual validation for UI | Root cause focus

### Pattern Storage
Internal timestamps only | Dynamic categorization | Auto-capture | Evolution tracking

### Vision Authority
@docs/vision/ â†’ Core â†’ Implementation | All decisions traceable to vision

## Architecture Standards
**Single Responsibility**: One purpose | Clear boundaries | Focused | Modular
**Orchestration**: Simple blocks â†’ Orchestrators â†’ Complex workflows

## Quality Gates with Implementation Verification
### Pre-Development (MANDATORY)
**Implementation Verification Authority**: user-input/technical-requirements/implementation-verification-mandatory-user.md
- PTS pre-check (2 min) | Vision alignment | Principle compliance | Resource planning
- **Pre-Implementation Verification**: Scope definition, authority alignment, implementation plan validation
- **Blocking Condition**: 100% checklist completion required before proceeding

### During Development (INCREMENTAL MANDATORY)
Real-time PTS | Line monitoring | Standards compliance | Integration testing
- **Progress Verification**: Step completion, quality validation, integration tests, no regression
- **Coherence Maintenance**: Authority flow intact, vision alignment, technical compliance
- **Blocking Condition**: Any checkpoint failure requires immediate stop and re-planning

### Post-Development (FINAL MANDATORY)
Full PTS (12/12) | Integration verified | Docs updated | Patterns captured
- **Completeness Verification**: All objectives met, success criteria achieved, integration successful
- **System Integrity**: Coherence validation passed, PTS compliance verified, authority structure intact
- **Documentation & Knowledge Transfer**: Complete documentation, maintenance guidelines, troubleshooting info
- **Blocking Condition**: 100% final verification required for "done" status

## Workflow Integration
### Planning Protocol
Context â†’ Vision â†’ UltraThink x4 â†’ Parallel design â†’ Execute

### Tool Usage
Task Tool priority | Parallel execution | Context economy | @docs/rules/tool-usage-protocols.md

### Documentation
Update CLAUDE.md | Capture learnings | Maintain references | Pattern evolution
