# Command Governance Framework - Consolidated

**Updated**: 2025-07-26 | **Authority**: Core governance structure  
**Source**: Consolidated from frameworks/command-governance-framework.md  
**Purpose**: Framework de governance que mantiene la excelencia arquitectural del sistema de comandos

## STP-Compliant Governance Structure

### Authority Hierarchy
```yaml
Level 1 - STP Foundation (ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY):
  Authority: Simplicidad Técnica Pragmática (12 componentes)
  Enforcement: Blocking - no development proceeds without STP compliance
  Scope: ALL system components without exception
  
Level 2 - Development Principles (FUNDAMENTAL AUTHORITY):
  Authority: 33 principios in 6 tiers
  Enforcement: Progressive - tier-based validation and compliance
  Scope: All architectural and implementation decisions

Level 3 - Vision Authority (DIRECTIONAL AUTHORITY):  
  Authority: user-input/vision/ directory contents
  Enforcement: Alignment requirement - all development serves vision
  Scope: Strategic direction and system evolution

Level 4 - Implementation Authority (TECHNICAL AUTHORITY):
  Authority: Command architecture and shared patterns
  Enforcement: Consistency requirement - pattern adherence mandatory
  Scope: Technical implementation standards and quality
```

## Command Standards Framework

### New Command Creation Standards

#### Tier 0 - STP Mandatory Compliance with Think×4
```yaml
Pre-Development Requirements (BLOCKING):
  1. Think×4 Pre-Analysis (MANDATORY FIRST STEP):
     - Think: Basic command concept and immediate purpose
     - Think Hard: Deeper implications and complexity analysis
     - Think Harder: Multi-system integration and long-term impact
     - Ultra Think: Optimal architecture serving user's ultimate vision
     - Documentation: Complete Think×4 analysis evidence required
     
  2. STP Pre-Filter Validation (FOLLOWING Think×4):
     - Complete 12-component STP assessment using Think×4 insights
     - 12/12 passing score REQUIRED
     - Evidence documentation MANDATORY
     - No exceptions or waivers permitted
     
  3. STP Integration Validation:
     - Cross-component integration assessment
     - System coherence maintenance
     - Authority hierarchy respect
     - No conflicts with existing STP compliance

STP Governance Protocol with Think×4:
  Step 0: Think×4 Pre-Analysis (5 minutes) - MANDATORY FIRST
    - Complete Think×4 methodology application
    - Document analysis at all 4 cognitive levels
    - Generate insights for STP validation
    
  Step 1: Concept STP Assessment (2 minutes) - Using Think×4 insights
    - Elevator pitch test (≤30 seconds explanation)
    - Single purpose test (exactly one responsibility)
    - Simplicity test (simplest effective solution)
    
  Step 2: Complete STP Validation (10 minutes) - Enhanced by Think×4
    - All 12 STP components validated using Think×4 insights
    - Evidence collection for each component
    - Integration impact assessment
    
  Step 3: STP Authority Confirmation (5 minutes)
    - Authority hierarchy compliance
    - System integration validation
    - Think×4 + STP cross-validation
    - Final approval required

Blocking Conditions:
  - ANY STP component failure blocks all development
  - Insufficient evidence blocks progression
  - Integration conflicts block approval
```

#### Progressive Standards (Tier 1-5)
```yaml
Tier 1 Standards (Fundamentals):
  - KISS: Simplest solution demonstration required
  - SOLID: All 5 principles compliance mandatory
  - DRY: No duplication allowed, SSOT integration required
  - YAGNI: Usage evidence required for all features

Tier 2 Standards (Critical):
  - Separation of Concerns: Clear boundaries demonstration
  - Fail Fast: Early error detection with clear guidance
  - Convention over Configuration: Sensible defaults required
  - Least Surprise: Predictable behavior validation

Tier 3-5 Standards (Progressive):
  - Architecture alignment with existing system
  - Quality gates appropriate for tier level
  - User experience consistency maintenance
  - Performance standards for tier complexity
```
