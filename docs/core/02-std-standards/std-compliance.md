**Assessment Scale**: ‚úÖ Excellent | üü° Good | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Improvement | ‚ùå Poor

## Development Principles Framework

ce-simple follows a comprehensive set of 20 development principles organized in 5 tiers by importance and application. These principles guide all system development, command creation, architectural decisions, and modularization strategies.

**Philosophy**: Simple implementation of proven principles that solve real problems without over-engineering, with special focus on modular design and progressive disclosure.

### Tier 1 - Fundamentals

#### 1. KISS (Keep It Simple)
**Definition**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - favor simplicity over complexity
**Application in ce-simple**:
- 3 essential commands instead of 111+ complex ones
- Clear, single-purpose functions
- Minimal abstraction layers
**Example**: `commands/init-project.md` - straightforward project setup without unnecessary options

#### 2. SOLID Principles (Complete Framework)
**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class/function has one reason to change
**Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Open for extension, closed for modification  
**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes
**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Many specific interfaces better than one general interface
**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
**Application in ce-simple**:
- Each command handles one specific workflow (SRP)
- Commands can be extended without modification (OCP)
- Command interfaces are substitutable (LSP)
- Specific command interfaces vs general command interface (ISP)
- Commands depend on documented interfaces, not implementations (DIP)
**Example**: Commands reference `docs/vision/` (abstraction) rather than hard-coding requirements

#### 3. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
**Definition**: Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous representation
**Application in ce-simple**:
- Single source of truth in `docs/vision/` for all system direction
- Shared templates in `docs/templates/`
- Common patterns documented once in `docs/frameworks/`
**Example**: All commands reference the same vision documents rather than duplicating requirements

#### 4. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
**Definition**: Don't implement functionality until it's actually needed
**Application in ce-simple**:
- Archived 111 commands that weren't essential
- Focus on 3 proven, practical commands
- No speculative features or "just in case" complexity
**Example**: Complex orchestration features archived until specifically needed

### Tier 2 - Critical for ce-simple

#### 5. Separation of Concerns
**Definition**: Separate different aspects of the program into distinct sections
**Application in ce-simple**:
- Clear separation: commands/, docs/, templates/
- Vision (docs/vision/) separate from implementation (docs/core/)
- Standards separate from execution
**Example**: `docs/vision/overview.md` defines WHAT, `docs/core/` defines HOW

#### 6. Fail Fast
**Definition**: Detect and report errors as early as possible
**Application in ce-simple**:
- Commands validate inputs immediately
- Clear error messages with specific guidance
- Validation before execution, not during
**Example**: Command validation checks required parameters before starting work

#### 7. Convention over Configuration
**Definition**: Use sensible defaults and conventions to reduce required configuration
**Application in ce-simple**:
- Standard project structure assumptions
- Conventional file locations (CLAUDE.md, docs/, commands/)
- Default workflows that work without customization
**Example**: `/init-project` assumes standard git workflow without requiring configuration

#### 8. Principle of Least Surprise
**Definition**: System behavior should be predictable and follow expected patterns
**Application in ce-simple**:
- Consistent command naming and structure
- Predictable file organization
- Commands behave as their names suggest
**Example**: `/explore-codebase` explores code, doesn't modify anything

### Tier 3 - Very Important

#### 9. Composition over Inheritance
**Definition**: Favor object composition over class inheritance for flexibility
**Application in ce-simple**:
- Commands compose functionality from core documents
- Modular documentation that can be recombined
- Flexible system architecture
**Example**: Commands combine vision + standards + templates rather than inheriting complex hierarchies

#### 10. Loose Coupling, High Cohesion
**Definition**: Minimize dependencies between modules, maximize internal module coherence
**Application in ce-simple**:
- Commands are independent and self-contained
- Clear interfaces between documentation sections
- Each document has a focused, cohesive purpose
**Example**: Commands can be used independently without requiring other commands

#### 11. Immutability
**Definition**: Objects should not be modified after creation when possible
**Application in ce-simple**:
- Vision documents are authoritative and stable
- Command templates provide immutable patterns
- Core principles remain consistent across evolution
**Example**: `docs/vision/` provides stable foundation that other components reference

### Tier 4 - Modularization & Reusability

#### 12. Modular Design Principle
**Definition**: Design components as independent, reusable modules with clear interfaces
**Application in ce-simple**:
- Commands are self-contained modules that can work independently
- Documentation sections are modular and can be recombined
- Archive system preserves modular components for future reuse
**Example**: `archive/commands-backup-2025-07-23/` - 111 commands organized in modular categories

#### 13. Information Hiding / Encapsulation
**Definition**: Hide implementation details, expose only necessary interfaces
**Application in ce-simple**:
- Commands hide complex orchestration behind simple interfaces
- `docs/core/` encapsulates architectural complexity 
- Implementation details hidden in specialized documentation
**Example**: `/start` hides assessment complexity behind simple project guidance interface

#### 14. Progressive Disclosure
**Definition**: Present information gradually, showing complexity only when needed
**Application in ce-simple**:
- CLAUDE.md provides overview, detailed docs available via links
- Simple commands first, archived commands for advanced needs
- Layer documentation from basic concepts to detailed implementation
**Example**: Documentation structure: overview ‚Üí core principles ‚Üí detailed frameworks ‚Üí implementation guides

#### 15. Orthogonality
**Definition**: Changes in one component don't affect other components
**Application in ce-simple**:
- Commands operate independently without side effects on others
- Documentation sections can be updated without affecting other sections  
- Archive system preserves orthogonal command functionality
**Example**: Modifying `/init-project` doesn't affect `/explore-codebase` functionality

#### 16. Principle of Abstraction
**Definition**: Create appropriate abstraction layers to manage complexity
**Application in ce-simple**:
- `docs/vision/` provides high-level system abstractions
- `docs/core/` provides architectural abstractions
- Commands provide workflow abstractions over complex operations
**Example**: `/init-project` abstracts git setup, directory creation, and documentation generation

### Tier 5 - System Architecture

#### 17. Single Source of Truth (SSOT)
**Definition**: Each piece of information should have exactly one authoritative representation
**Application in ce-simple**:
- `docs/vision/` is absolute authority for system direction
- CLAUDE.md is the single system overview
- No conflicting or duplicate documentation
**Example**: All system changes must originate from and align with `docs/vision/`

#### 18. Principle of Least Privilege
**Definition**: Give only the minimum access/permissions necessary to accomplish a task
**Application in ce-simple**:
- Commands only access files they need to modify
- Clear scope boundaries for each operation
- Minimal system impact by default
**Example**: `/explore-codebase` only reads files, never modifies them

#### 19. Graceful Degradation
**Definition**: System should continue functioning even when components fail
**Application in ce-simple**:
- Commands work independently if others fail
- Core functionality preserved even if advanced features unavailable
- Clear fallback strategies
**Example**: System works with just `/init-project` even if other commands are unavailable

#### 20. Progressive Enhancement
**Definition**: Start with basic functionality, add advanced features incrementally
**Application in ce-simple**:
- 3 essential commands provide core functionality
- 111 archived commands available for advanced needs
- Basic workflows work immediately, complex ones available on demand
**Example**: Start with `/init-project`, add `/explore-codebase` and `/start` as needed
