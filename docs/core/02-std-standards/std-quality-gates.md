### Content Requirements
- [ ] **Essential Only**: Only essential understanding included
- [ ] **No Procedures**: No step-by-step procedures included
- [ ] **No Technical Details**: No code, configuration, or tool instructions
- [ ] **Key Concepts**: 3-5 concepts maximum, 1 line each
- [ ] **Integration Points**: How methodology connects with system
- [ ] **Quick Reference**: Links to templates and resources

## Implementation Layer Validation

### Structure Requirements
- [ ] **Prerequisites Section**: Required setup + dependencies clearly defined
- [ ] **Core Process Section**: Step-by-step workflow documented
- [ ] **Integration Section**: Connection points with other components
- [ ] **Troubleshooting Section**: Common issues + solutions included
