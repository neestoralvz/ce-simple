**Authority Level**: Core Technical Framework  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-23  
**Status**: Active Implementation Framework

## Governing Principle Definition

**PRAGMATIC TECHNICAL SIMPLICITY (PTS)**: The absolute meta-principle governing all other principles in the ce-simple system.

Direct, forceful, and technically precise solutions that say exactly what's necessary at the exact point, with sober, concise, clear, coherent, effective, and pragmatic structure.

## The 12 PTS Components

### Technical Cluster

#### 1. **Directness**

- **Criteria**: Information density ≥ 0.80, no redundancy
- **Measurement**: Value/complexity ratio ≥ 2.0
- **ce-simple Example**: 111+ archived commands → 3 essential commands maintained 100% critical functionality

### Cognitive Cluster

#### 9. **Clarity**
- **Definition**: Immediate comprehension without ambiguity
- **Criteria**: Understanding time ≤ 5 minutes, 0 ambiguities
- **Measurement**: Comprehension rate ≥ 0.95 on first reading

#### 10. **Coherence**
- **Definition**: Absolute internal consistency
- **Criteria**: 100% conceptual coherence, 0 contradictions
- **Measurement**: Internal consistency index = 1.0
- **ce-simple Example**: All commands follow same template and principles

#### 11. **Effectiveness**
- **Definition**: Produces measurable and successful results
- **Criteria**: Success rate ≥ 90%, objective achieved measurably
- **Measurement**: Goal achievement rate ≥ 0.90, user satisfaction ≥ 0.85
- **ce-simple Example**: Commands achieve successful setup/analysis/guidance in >90% cases

#### 12. **Pragmatism**
- **Definition**: Works effectively under real conditions
- **Criteria**: Real-world applicability 100%, functional in production
- **Measurement**: Production success rate ≥ 0.95, maintenance overhead ≤ 5%
- **ce-simple Example**: System works consistently in real projects without configuration

## Meticulous Application Framework

### Exhaustive Compliance Principle

**"All 12 PTS components are applied meticulously and exhaustively in every line of code, document, command, and architectural decision. NO EXCEPTIONS."**

### PTS Validation Process

#### Phase 1: Pre-evaluation (2 minutes)
```markdown
- [ ] What is the specific purpose? (Clarity test)
- [ ] Does it solve exactly one problem? (Sufficiency test)  
- [ ] Is it the simplest solution that works? (Directness test)
- [ ] Does it work without additional configuration? (Pragmatism test)
```

#### Phase 2: Complete Evaluation (10 minutes)
- Validate all 12 PTS components individually
- Verify absence of blocking criteria
- Measure quantitative metrics where applicable
- Document trade-offs and decisions

#### Phase 3: Contextual Validation (5 minutes)  
- Coherence with Tier 1-5 principles
- Alignment with docs/vision/
- Integration with existing system
- Impact on maintainability

### PTS Blocking Criteria

**Any failure in PTS components = IMMEDIATE STOP**

#### Critical Blocking (Stops development)
- Purpose not clear in <30 seconds (Clarity failure)
- Multiple responsibilities (Sufficiency failure)  
- Evident unnecessary complexity (Sobriety failure)
- Doesn't work without configuration (Pragmatism failure)

#### Quality Blocking (Requires correction)
- Technical metrics <90% (Technical Excellence failure)
- Redundant information >20% (Conciseness failure)
- Non-intuitive navigation (Structure failure)
- Requirements drift >5% (Exactitude failure)

## Integration with Existing Principles

### PTS as Meta-principle

**PTS governs all other principles:**

- **SOLID + PTS**: Solid architecture AND pragmatically valuable
- **DRY + PTS**: Eliminate duplication only if it reduces practical complexity  
- **YAGNI + PTS**: Implement only proven pragmatic value
- **Fail Fast + PTS**: Early detection with direct and clear guidance

### Absolute Priority

**In principle conflicts: PTS wins always**

1. PTS evaluation first
2. If passes PTS, apply Tier 1-5
3. If conflict between tiers, PTS is final arbiter
4. Document decision with PTS justification

## System PTS Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics

```yaml
DirectnessMetrics:
  avg_steps_to_objective: "≤3"
  time_efficiency_ratio: "≥0.90"

- ⚠️ Precision (some ambiguous instructions)
- ❌ Conciseness (could be more dense)

**`/explore-codebase`**: 8/12 PTS compliance  
- ✅ Technical Excellence, Structure, Effectiveness
- ⚠️ Conciseness (163 lines), Clarity (complex explanation)
- ❌ Directness (too many meta-descriptions)

**`/start`**: 11/12 PTS compliance
