# Category-Based Priority Scoring and Urgency Detection

**Purpose**: Intelligent priority assessment and urgency detection for categorized feedback  
**Authority**: Performance layer - strategic prioritization algorithms  
**Think×4**: Sophisticated scoring with adaptive urgency recognition  
**Lines**: ≤200

## Priority Scoring Framework

### Base Category Priority Weights
```
errores     (Errors):     0.90 - Critical system issues requiring immediate attention
obstaculos  (Obstacles):  0.80 - High-impact blockers preventing progress
desafios    (Challenges): 0.60 - Medium-priority growth opportunities
aprendizajes(Learnings):  0.55 - Medium-strategic value for system improvement
logros      (Achievements): 0.40 - Low-priority positive reinforcement
```

### Dynamic Priority Modifiers

**Frequency Multiplier** (1.0-2.0)
- Single occurrence: 1.0x base weight
- 2-3 occurrences: 1.2x base weight
- 4-6 occurrences: 1.5x base weight
- 7+ occurrences: 2.0x base weight

**Impact Assessment Multiplier** (0.8-2.5)
- Individual impact: 0.8x base weight
- Team impact: 1.2x base weight
- Project impact: 1.8x base weight
- System-wide impact: 2.5x base weight

**Temporal Urgency Multiplier** (1.0-3.0)
- Historical feedback: 1.0x base weight
- Recent feedback (24h): 1.5x base weight
- Real-time feedback: 2.0x base weight
- Escalated feedback: 3.0x base weight

### Composite Priority Calculation
```
final_priority = base_weight × frequency_multiplier × impact_multiplier × temporal_multiplier

Priority Ranges:
- Critical (0.8-1.0): Immediate action required
- High (0.6-0.7): Action needed within 24 hours
- Medium (0.4-0.5): Action needed within week
- Low (0.2-0.3): Action needed when resources available
- Minimal (0.0-0.1): Informational only
```

## Urgency Detection Algorithms

### Error-Category Urgency Signals

**Critical Error Indicators**:
- System crash or complete failure patterns
- Data loss or corruption indicators
- Security vulnerability mentions
- Performance degradation >50%
- User workflow complete blockage

**High Error Indicators**:
- Feature malfunction affecting multiple users
- Integration failure with external systems
- Performance issues affecting productivity
- Regression from previous working state
- Quality assurance test failures

### Obstacle-Category Urgency Signals

**Critical Obstacle Indicators**:
- Resource unavailability blocking all progress
- External dependency complete failure
- Legal/compliance blocking issues
- Budget/resource exhaustion situations
- Technical debt causing system instability

**High Obstacle Indicators**:
- Team productivity significantly reduced
- Multiple workflows affected simultaneously
- Resource constraints affecting deadlines
- Technical limitations requiring architecture changes
- Process inefficiencies causing delays

### Adaptive Urgency Recognition

**Pattern Learning System**:
```
1. Historical Urgency Tracking: Learn from past urgent situations
2. Escalation Pattern Recognition: Identify feedback leading to escalations
3. User Behavior Analysis: Detect urgency from communication patterns
4. Context-Aware Adjustment: Modify urgency based on project phase
5. Correlation-Based Prediction: Use category correlations for urgency prediction
```

**Real-Time Urgency Indicators**:
- Multiple related feedback items in short timeframe
- Escalation keywords: "urgent", "critical", "ASAP", "immediately"
- Negative sentiment escalation patterns
- User frustration indicators in feedback tone
- System performance metric correlation

## Multi-Category Priority Integration

### Cross-Category Priority Boost
```
Error + Obstacle Combination: +0.2 priority boost
Challenge + Learning Combination: +0.1 priority boost
Multiple Category Assignment: +0.05 per additional category
Correlation-Predicted Issues: +0.15 preventive boost
```

### Priority Conflict Resolution
```
1. Always prioritize error-category feedback highest
2. Use temporal urgency as tiebreaker for same base priority
3. Consider impact scope for final prioritization
4. Apply user escalation override for manual priority adjustment
```

### Strategic Priority Balancing
```
1. Ensure minimum percentage allocation to each category
2. Prevent error-only focus neglecting strategic improvements
3. Balance immediate needs with long-term system health
4. Maintain learning and achievement recognition priorities
```

## Urgency Detection Integration

### Real-Time Monitoring System
```
1. Continuous feedback stream analysis
2. Pattern recognition for urgency indicators
3. Threshold-based alert generation
4. Escalation pathway activation
5. Stakeholder notification protocols
```

### Automated Response Triggers
```
Critical Priority (0.8-1.0):
  - Immediate notification to responsible teams
  - Escalation to management within 30 minutes
  - Resource reallocation authorization
  - Status communication to stakeholders

High Priority (0.6-0.7):
  - Notification within 2 hours
  - Assignment to appropriate team members
  - Progress tracking activation
  - Regular status updates required
```

### Predictive Urgency Modeling
```
1. Trend Analysis: Identify feedback patterns leading to urgent situations
2. Early Warning Systems: Alert before issues become urgent
3. Preventive Action Recommendations: Suggest proactive measures
4. Resource Planning: Anticipate resource needs based on urgency trends
```

## Performance Metrics and Optimization

### Priority Accuracy Tracking
- Correlation between assigned priority and actual resolution time
- User satisfaction with priority assignment accuracy
- False positive/negative urgency detection rates
- Priority adjustment frequency and reasons

### System Performance Optimization
```
1. Algorithm tuning based on historical accuracy
2. Threshold adjustment for improved precision
3. User feedback integration for priority calibration
4. Continuous learning from priority assignment outcomes
```

### Dashboard Integration
- Real-time priority distribution visualization
- Urgency trend analysis and patterns
- Category-specific priority heatmaps
- Priority accuracy metrics and improvement tracking
