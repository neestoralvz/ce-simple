## Governing Principle Definition

**PRAGMATIC TECHNICAL SIMPLICITY (PTS)**: The absolute meta-principle governing all other principles in the ce-simple system.

Direct, forceful, and technically precise solutions that say exactly what's necessary at the exact point, with sober, concise, clear, coherent, effective, and pragmatic structure.

## Think×4 Validation Methodology (🧠 MANDATORY)

**Integration**: Think×4 analysis is REQUIRED before applying PTS framework validation  
**Authority**: user-input/technical-requirements/think-by-four-mandatory.md  
**Scope**: ALL significant decisions, analyses, and recommendations

### Think×4 Process (Pre-PTS Validation)
1. **Think**: Basic understanding - What problem does this solve? What's the immediate approach? What are the obvious constraints?
2. **Think Hard**: Deeper analysis - What are the implications? What complexity is hidden? What dependencies exist? What could go wrong?
3. **Think Harder**: Multi-system view - How does this integrate with existing systems? What are long-term consequences? How does it affect scalability?
4. **Ultra Think**: Optimal synthesis - What's the best overall architecture? How does it serve the user's ultimate vision? What's the most elegant solution?

### Think×4 + PTS Integration Framework
**Mandatory Sequence** (🛑 BLOCKING):
1. **Pre-Analysis**: Apply complete Think×4 analysis to understand problem/solution comprehensively
2. **Informed Evaluation**: Use Think×4 insights to inform each of the 12 PTS component evaluations
3. **Enhanced Validation**: Apply 12-component PTS validation using Think×4 enhanced understanding
4. **Cross-Validation**: Validate final solution against both Think×4 insights and PTS criteria
5. **Documentation**: Document both Think×4 analysis and PTS validation results

### Think×4 Application Examples
**Technical Decisions**: Think (what to build) → Think Hard (how it fits) → Think Harder (system impact) → Ultra Think (optimal architecture)
**Problem Analysis**: Think (problem scope) → Think Hard (root causes) → Think Harder (systemic issues) → Ultra Think (comprehensive solution)
**Implementation Strategy**: Think (basic approach) → Think Hard (complexity factors) → Think Harder (integration challenges) → Ultra Think (best execution path)

**Quality Gate**: No PTS validation without completed Think×4 analysis documentation and evidence.

## Authority & Integration

### PTS as Meta-principle
**PTS governs all other principles:**
- In principle conflicts: PTS wins always
- PTS evaluation first, then apply Tier 1-5
- Document decisions with PTS justification

### Conflict Resolution Protocol
**When PTS components conflict:**
1. **Priority Order**: Effectiveness → Directness → Precision → Clarity
2. **Resolution Process**: Identify conflicts, apply priority, seek win-win solution, document rationale

## Binary Validation Protocol

**Authority**: All 12 PTS components must achieve binary pass/fail validation
- **12/12 Compliance Required**: All components must pass
- **Blocking Standard**: Non-compliance prevents implementation
- **Quality Gate**: PTS validation required for all system additions

**PTS Mantra**: *"≤3 steps, measurable accuracy, technical quality ≥90%, production success ≥95% - no exceptions."*
