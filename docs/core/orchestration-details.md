# Task Orchestration - Detailed Specifications

## Purpose
Advanced orchestration techniques, detailed implementation patterns, and comprehensive examples for task coordination.

## Advanced Task Tool Capabilities

### Sub-Agent Architecture Details
```yaml
Sub-Agent Properties:
  - Independent execution context
  - Full tool access (Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash)
  - Cannot see other sub-agents
  - Cannot access parent context
  - Must receive complete instructions
  - Maximum 10 concurrent per command
```

### Task Instruction Framework
```yaml
Effective Task Instructions:
  Objective: Single clear goal
  Context: All necessary background information
  Steps: Specific sequential actions
  Success Criteria: Measurable outcomes
  Output Format: Structured result format
  Error Handling: What to do if things fail
```

## Sophisticated Orchestration Patterns

### Competitive Redundancy Pattern
For critical operations requiring reliability:
```yaml
Strategy:
  - Deploy multiple agents with same task
  - Use different approaches per agent
  - Compare results for quality
  - Select best outcome automatically

Example:
  - Agent 1: Conservative implementation
  - Agent 2: Modern best practices  
  - Agent 3: Innovative techniques
  - Compare: Performance, maintainability, correctness
```

### Hierarchical Decomposition
For complex multi-level tasks:
```yaml
Level 1: High-level coordination
  - Deploy domain specialists
  - Manage inter-domain dependencies
  - Aggregate domain results

Level 2: Domain specialists
  - Handle specific problem areas
  - Deploy focused micro-tasks
  - Ensure domain consistency

Level 3: Micro-tasks
  - Specific file operations
  - Targeted searches
  - Focused validations
```

### Resource-Aware Orchestration
```yaml
Resource Monitoring:
  - File system load tracking
  - API rate limit awareness
  - Memory usage monitoring
  - Network capacity assessment

Adaptive Strategies:
  - Reduce parallelism if constrained
  - Queue tasks when at limits
  - Batch similar operations
  - Graceful degradation patterns
```

## Advanced Result Processing

### Conflict Resolution Strategies
```yaml
Merge Conflicts:
  - Semantic analysis of differences
  - Priority-based resolution
  - User preference application
  - Automated reconciliation

Content Conflicts:
  - Version comparison algorithms
  - Change impact assessment
  - Intelligent merging
  - Fallback to user decision

Logic Conflicts:
  - Approach comparison metrics
  - Performance-based selection
  - Quality score evaluation
  - Hybrid solution creation
```

### Pattern Extraction Algorithms
```yaml

```

## Performance Optimization

### Parallelization Efficiency
```yaml
Optimal Task Sizing:
  - Large enough to minimize overhead
  - Small enough for good distribution
  - Balanced cognitive load
  - Clear completion criteria

Load Balancing:
  - Even work distribution
  - Skill-based task assignment
  - Resource availability matching
  - Dynamic rebalancing
```

### Execution Monitoring
```yaml
Real-time Metrics:
  - Task completion rates
  - Resource utilization
  - Quality indicators
  - User satisfaction

Performance Tuning:
  - Bottleneck identification
  - Resource optimization
  - Strategy refinement
  - Continuous improvement
```

## Git WorkTree Integration

### Advanced Isolation Techniques
```yaml
Conflict-Free Development:
  - Automatic branch creation
  - Isolated file systems
  - Independent dependency trees
  - Clean merge strategies

Parallel Development:
  - Multi-agent file editing
  - Simultaneous feature development
  - Independent testing environments
  - Coordinated integration
```

### Merge Intelligence
```yaml
Smart Integration:
  - Semantic conflict detection
  - Automated resolution strategies
  - Quality-preserving merges
  - Rollback capabilities

History Management:
  - Comprehensive audit trails
  - Change attribution
  - Decision documentation
  - Performance tracking
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Failure Mode Analysis
```yaml
Common Failure Types:
  - Task timeout errors
  - Resource unavailability
  - Logic contradictions
  - Quality threshold failures

Recovery Strategies:
  - Automatic retry with backoff
  - Partial result recovery
  - Alternative approach deployment
  - Graceful degradation
```

### Quality Assurance Protocols
```yaml
Multi-Level Validation:
  - Individual task validation
  - Cross-task consistency checks
  - Aggregated result verification
  - User acceptance criteria

Continuous Quality Monitoring:
  - Real-time quality metrics
  - Trend analysis
  - Predictive quality assessment
  - Proactive intervention
```
