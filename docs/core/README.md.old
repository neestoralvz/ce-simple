## Compliance by Tier

### Tier 0 - PTS Foundation (MANDATORY)

**12 Components applied to ALL commands:**

**Technical Cluster:**
- **Directness**: Direct path to objective without detours
- **Precision**: Forceful and specific technical accuracy
- **Sufficiency**: Exactly what's necessary, complete
- **Technical Excellence**: Impeccable technical quality

**Communication Cluster:**
- **Exactitude**: Implementation at exact required point
- **Sobriety**: Sober approach without embellishments
- **Structure**: Logical, clear, structured organization
- **Conciseness**: Maximum value per unit of complexity

**Cognitive Cluster:**
- **Clarity**: Immediate comprehension without ambiguity
- **Coherence**: Absolute internal consistency
- **Effectiveness**: Produces measurable and successful results
- **Pragmatism**: Works effectively under real conditions

### Tier 1 - Fundamentals

**KISS (Keep It Simple):**
- Core commands: minimal viable functionality
- Advanced: extended functionality without unnecessary complexity
- Specialized: maximum functionality with simple interface

**SOLID Principles:**
- **SRP**: Each command has single responsibility
- **OCP**: Extensible via advanced/specialized without modifying core
- **LSP**: Commands substitutable in similar interfaces
- **ISP**: Specific interfaces per complexity level
- **DIP**: Dependencies on abstractions (docs/core/, shared/)

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**
- Shared patterns library eliminates duplication
- Common validation, error handling, completion patterns
- Single source of truth in docs/core/

**YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):**
- Core commands: only proven necessary functionality
- Advanced/Specialized: implemented only when need demonstrated

### Tier 2 - Critical

**Separation of Concerns:**
- Core: essential functionality separated
- Shared: common patterns separated
- Advanced/Specialized: extended functionality separated

**Fail Fast:**
- Upfront validation in each command
- Specific and actionable error messages
- Prerequisites check before execution

**Convention over Configuration:**
- Sensible defaults in all commands
- Predictable and standard structure
- Consistent naming conventions

**Least Surprise:**
- Names predict exact behavior
- Consistent behavior in similar commands
- Standard and predictable output format

### Tier 3 - Important

**Composition over Inheritance:**
- Commands compose from shared patterns
- Modular design enables flexible reuse
- No complex hierarchies, only composition

**Loose Coupling, High Cohesion:**
- Operationally independent commands
- High internal cohesion in each command
- Clear interfaces between commands

**Immutability:**
- Immutable core patterns in shared/
- Preserved stable interfaces
- Vision documents as immutable authority

### Tier 4 - Modularization

**Modular Design:**
- Self-contained commands with clear interfaces
- Reusable components in shared/
- Independent deployment and testing

**Information Hiding:**
- Hidden implementation details
- Exposed clean interfaces
- Encapsulated complexity

**Progressive Disclosure:**
- **Level 1 (Core)**: Essential functionality immediately accessible
- **Level 2 (Advanced)**: Extended functionality when needed
- **Level 3 (Specialized)**: Expert functionality for specific cases

**Orthogonality:**
- Commands operate independently
- No side effects between commands
- Localized changes without global impact

**Abstraction:**
- Appropriate abstraction layers per level
- Core: workflow abstractions
- Advanced: feature abstractions  
- Specialized: domain abstractions

### Tier 5 - Architecture

**Single Source of Truth (SSOT):**
- docs/vision/ = absolute authority
- docs/core/shared-patterns.md = pattern authority
- No conflicting documentation

**Least Privilege:**
- Commands access minimum required resources
- Defined clear scope boundaries
- Minimal system impact by design

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Built-in fallback strategies
- Core functionality preserved on failures
- Handled partial success scenarios

**Progressive Enhancement:**
- Basic functionality in core commands
- Enhanced features in advanced/ when needed
- Full system in specialized/ for expert cases
