## Quick Reference

**UltraThink x4 + PTS + 20 principles in 7 tiers** - Use this checklist for all development decisions:

### Tier 0 - ULTRATHINK X4 (Universal Cognitive Methodology) - MANDATORY THINKING FOUNDATION

**Definition**: Progressive layered analysis methodology applied to ALL actions using >1 tool or affecting >1 file. Foundation cognitive framework ensuring systematic understanding before solution development.

**Authority**: UltraThink x4 is the mandatory cognitive filter. All other principles apply ONLY after proper cognitive analysis has been completed.

#### The 4 Progressive Layers (ALL MANDATORY)
**Think (Layer 1)**: Foundation analysis → Core concepts, initial understanding, scope clarity  
**Think Hard (Layer 2)**: Deep analysis → Pattern recognition, trade-offs, dependencies  
**Think Harder (Layer 3)**: Complex integration → Multi-system coordination, risk assessment  
**Ultra Think (Layer 4)**: Ultra synthesis → Complete solution architecture, implementation roadmap

**Universal Application**: Analysis | Planning | Implementation | Validation | All multi-step processes
**Auto-Advancement**: Each layer determines if deeper analysis needed based on measurable criteria
**Quality Gates**: Validation criteria for advancement and completion at each layer

**🛑 BLOCKING REQUIREMENT**: Required thinking layer depth must be applied before proceeding.

## Core Philosophy

Simple implementation of proven principles that solve real problems without over-engineering.

**Priority when principles conflict:**
1. **UltraThink x4 Cognitive Foundation** (Tier 0 - absolute priority)
2. **PTS Technical Foundation** (Tier 1 - technical priority)
3. KISS (simplicity)
4. SSOT (single truth)
5. SRP (clear responsibility)

## Principle Details

### Tier 0 - UltraThink x4 Foundation (Universal Cognitive Methodology)

**OBLIGATORY COGNITIVE PRE-FILTER** - Must pass before applying any other principles.

UltraThink x4 represents the systematic cognitive approach to understanding problems before developing solutions. Every action using >1 tool or affecting >1 file requires systematic thinking depth:
- **Think**: Foundation understanding and scope definition
- **Think Hard**: Pattern analysis and trade-off evaluation  
- **Think Harder**: System integration and risk assessment
- **Ultra Think**: Complete solution architecture and roadmap

**ce-simple application:**
- All complex decisions use progressive cognitive layers
- Analysis depth matches problem complexity automatically
- Quality gates ensure appropriate cognitive rigor
- Universal application across all development phases

**Example:** Adding authentication feature → Think (requirements, basic approach) → Think Hard (OAuth vs JWT patterns, security considerations) → Think Harder (system integration, session management) → Ultra Think (complete implementation roadmap, testing strategy)

**Critical Integration:** UltraThink x4 precedes all other principles:
- **UltraThink x4 + PTS**: Proper analysis BEFORE technical filtering
- **UltraThink x4 + SOLID**: Cognitive depth BEFORE architectural decisions
- **UltraThink x4 + Planning**: Understanding BEFORE implementation design

**Blocking Enforcement:** Any complex action without appropriate thinking depth cannot proceed to principle evaluation. This ensures comprehensive understanding before solution development.

**Complete Framework:** See @docs/commands/think-layers-implementation.md for detailed methodology, auto-advancement criteria, and quality gates.

### Tier 1 - PTS Foundation (Pragmatic Technical Simplicity)

**OBLIGATORY PRE-FILTER** - Must pass before applying any other principles.

PTS represents the synthesis of technical excellence with pragmatic value. Every element must be simultaneously:
- **Simple**: Minimal complexity for maximum effect
- **Technical**: Architecturally sound and well-engineered  
- **Pragmatic**: Immediately useful and valuable

**ce-simple application:**
- 3 essential commands vs 111+ archived (PTS filter applied)
- Each command solves specific problem pragmatically
- Self-contained architecture enables practical reuse
- Clear purpose and immediate value

**Example:** `commands/init-project.md` passes all 12 PTS components - clear purpose (project setup), minimal implementation (essential steps only), single responsibility (initialization), immediate reuse (any project), evident maintainability (straightforward logic), direct verification (visible results), natural integration (standard conventions), self-evident documentation (clear steps), adequate performance (fast execution), clear error handling (informative failures), data principles (SSOT project structure), controlled evolution (extensible without breaking).

**Critical Integration:** PTS modifies how we apply traditional principles:
- **SOLID + PTS**: Architecture must be sound AND pragmatically valuable
- **DRY + PTS**: Eliminate duplication only if it reduces practical complexity
- **YAGNI + PTS**: Implement only what has proven pragmatic value

**Blocking Enforcement:** Any component failing PTS validation cannot proceed to other principle evaluation. This prevents over-engineering and ensures every element delivers practical value.

**Complete Framework:** See [PTS Checklist](pts-checklist.md) for comprehensive validation process, context-specific matrices, and integration guidelines.

### Tier 2 - Fundamentals

#### KISS (Keep It Simple)
Simplest solution that works.

**ce-simple application:**
- 3 essential commands vs 111+ complex ones
- Clear, single-purpose functions
- Minimal abstraction layers

**Example:** `commands/init-project.md` - straightforward setup without options

#### SOLID Principles
Complete framework for maintainable code.

**Single Responsibility (SRP):** One reason to change
**Open/Closed (OCP):** Open for extension, closed for modification
**Liskov Substitution (LSP):** Replaceable subtypes
**Interface Segregation (ISP):** Specific interfaces
**Dependency Inversion (DIP):** Depend on abstractions

**ce-simple application:**
- Each command handles one workflow (SRP)
- Commands extend without modification (OCP)
- Command interfaces are substitutable (LSP)
- Specific vs general interfaces (ISP)
- Reference abstractions not implementations (DIP)

**Example:** Commands reference `docs/vision/` (abstraction) not hard-coded requirements

#### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Every piece of knowledge has single representation.

**ce-simple application:**
- `docs/vision/` as single source for system direction
- Shared templates in `docs/templates/`
- Common patterns in `docs/frameworks/`

**Example:** All commands reference same vision documents

#### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
Don't implement until actually needed.

**ce-simple application:**
- Archived 111 unused commands
- Focus on 3 proven commands
- No speculative features

**Example:** Complex orchestration archived until needed

### Tier 3 - Critical

#### Separation of Concerns
Different aspects in distinct sections.

**ce-simple application:**
- Clear separation: `commands/`, `docs/`, `templates/`
- Vision separate from implementation
- Standards separate from execution

**Example:** `docs/vision/` defines WHAT, `docs/core/` defines HOW

#### Fail Fast
Detect errors early with clear guidance.

**ce-simple application:**
- Input validation before execution
- Clear error messages
- Upfront requirement checks

#### Convention over Configuration
Sensible defaults reduce configuration.

**ce-simple application:**

- Default workflows work immediately

#### Principle of Least Surprise
Predictable, expected behavior.

**ce-simple application:**
- Consistent naming and structure
- Commands behave as names suggest
- Predictable file organization

### Tier 4 - Important

### Tier 5 - Modularization

#### Modular Design
Independent, reusable components.

**ce-simple application:**
- Self-contained commands
- Modular documentation sections
- Archive preserves reusable components

#### Information Hiding/Encapsulation
Hide implementation, expose interfaces.

**ce-simple application:**
- Commands hide orchestration complexity
- `docs/core/` encapsulates architecture
- Simple interfaces for complex operations

#### Progressive Disclosure
Present information gradually.

**ce-simple application:**
- CLAUDE.md overview → detailed docs
- Simple commands → archived advanced features
- Layered documentation depth

#### Orthogonality
Independent components without side effects.

**ce-simple application:**
- Commands operate independently
- Documentation sections update independently
- Archive preserves orthogonal functionality

#### Principle of Abstraction
Appropriate abstraction layers.

**ce-simple application:**
- `docs/vision/` - high-level abstractions
- `docs/core/` - architectural abstractions  
- Commands - workflow abstractions

### Tier 6 - Architecture

#### Single Source of Truth (SSOT)
Exactly one authoritative representation.

**ce-simple application:**
- `docs/vision/` is absolute authority
- CLAUDE.md is single system overview
- No conflicting documentation

#### Principle of Least Privilege
Minimum necessary access.

**ce-simple application:**
- Commands access only required files
- Clear scope boundaries
- Minimal system impact

#### Graceful Degradation
Continue functioning when components fail.

**ce-simple application:**
- Commands work independently
- Core functionality preserved
- Clear fallback strategies

#### Progressive Enhancement
Basic functionality first, advanced features incrementally.
