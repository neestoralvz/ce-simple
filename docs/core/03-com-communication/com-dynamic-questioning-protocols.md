## Questioning Intelligence Framework

### Response Analysis Engine
```
Real-Time Response Processing:
1. Content Analysis:
   - Extract key concepts and terminology
   - Identify emotional indicators and engagement levels
   - Detect category signals (logros, desafios, errores, obstaculos, aprendizajes)
   - Assess response depth and completeness

2. Pattern Recognition:
   - Compare against historical user response patterns
   - Identify communication style preferences
   - Detect topic avoidance or enthusiasm indicators
   - Recognize expertise level and comfort zones

3. Context Integration:
   - Integrate current response with session context
   - Connect to previous feedback sessions for continuity
   - Align with current project state and development focus
   - Consider recent system activities and usage patterns
```

### Adaptive Question Generation Algorithm
```
Dynamic Question Creation Process:
1. Category Signal Detection:
   IF response contains logros indicators → Generate achievement exploration questions
   IF response contains desafios indicators → Generate challenge development questions
   IF response contains errores indicators → Generate error analysis questions
   IF response contains obstaculos indicators → Generate obstacle resolution questions
   IF response contains aprendizajes indicators → Generate learning expansion questions

2. Depth Assessment and Adjustment:
   IF response_depth = low → Generate clarifying questions
   IF response_depth = medium → Generate expansion questions
   IF response_depth = high → Generate exploration questions
   IF response_depth = expert → Generate innovation questions

3. Engagement Optimization:
   IF engagement_level = high → Continue current questioning approach
   IF engagement_level = medium → Adjust question style and complexity
   IF engagement_level = low → Simplify questions and change topic angle
   IF engagement_level = dropping → Switch category or approach
```

- "What alternative approaches might circumvent this constraint?"
- "Who or what could help eliminate this impediment?"

### Aprendizajes (Learnings) Question Bank
**Initial Discovery Questions:**
- "What insights have you gained from your recent work with the system?"
- "What has surprised you about how things actually work versus your expectations?"
- "What patterns or principles have you discovered through experience?"

**Knowledge Expansion Questions:**
- "How might this insight apply to other areas of your work?"
- "What implications does this learning have for future projects?"
- "How would you explain this insight to someone new to the system?"

**Application Strategy Questions:**

- "How might this learning influence system improvements?"

## Dynamic Adaptation Protocols

### Real-Time Question Adjustment
```
Response Quality Assessment:
1. Clarity Indicators:
   - Clear, specific language = Continue current depth level
   - Vague or general responses = Ask clarifying questions
   - Technical detail = Adjust to match user expertise level
   - Emotional content = Explore underlying feelings or concerns

2. Engagement Signals:
   - Enthusiastic responses = Explore deeper in current area
   - Short responses = Switch questioning approach or category
   - Detailed explanations = Continue with follow-up questions
   - Confused responses = Simplify or rephrase questions

3. Category Coverage Balance:
   - Track category coverage throughout session
   - Ensure all five categories receive appropriate attention
   - Adjust questioning to address under-covered categories
   - Balance user interest areas with comprehensive coverage needs
```

### Context-Aware Question Selection
```
Contextual Factors Integration:
1. Project Phase Consideration:
   - Early project phase = Focus on setup and initial experience
   - Mid project phase = Focus on workflow and efficiency
   - Late project phase = Focus on completion and retrospective
   - Post project phase = Focus on outcomes and learnings

2. User Expertise Adaptation:
   - Beginner users = Focus on basic functionality and support needs
   - Intermediate users = Focus on workflow optimization and efficiency
   - Advanced users = Focus on complex scenarios and edge cases
   - Expert users = Focus on innovation opportunities and system evolution

3. Recent Activity Integration:
   - Recent errors = Prioritize error category exploration
   - Recent successes = Explore achievement patterns and replication
   - New features used = Focus on learning and adaptation experience
   - Workflow changes = Explore challenge and obstacle categories
```

### Session Flow Optimization
```
Dynamic Session Management:
1. Opening Question Strategy:
   - Start with most relevant recent context
   - Begin with positive or neutral territory when possible
   - Use previous session insights for continuity
   - Adapt opening style to user communication preferences

2. Transition Management:
   - Use natural bridges between categories based on user responses
   - Recognize when to pursue deeper versus when to move on
   - Balance comprehensive coverage with natural conversation flow
   - Adapt transition timing to user engagement and energy levels

3. Closing Question Framework:
   - Synthesize key themes identified during session
   - Ensure critical areas have been adequately covered
   - Provide opportunity for user to add anything not addressed
   - Confirm understanding and validate key insights gathered
```

## Question Effectiveness Metrics

### Real-Time Quality Assessment
```
Response Quality Indicators:
- Response Length: Longer responses often indicate engagement and understanding
- Specificity Level: Specific examples and details indicate clear understanding
- Emotional Indicators: Positive/negative sentiment reveals true user experience
- Category Clarity: Clear category signals indicate effective question targeting

Question Effectiveness Scores:
- High Effectiveness (0.8-1.0): Elicits detailed, specific, category-clear responses
- Medium Effectiveness (0.5-0.7): Generates adequate responses with some clarity
- Low Effectiveness (0.0-0.4): Produces vague, short, or confused responses
```

### Adaptive Learning Integration
