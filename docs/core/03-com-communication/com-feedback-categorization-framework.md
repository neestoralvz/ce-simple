## 5-Category Classification System

### Category Definitions

**logros** (Achievements/Successes)
- Successful completion of objectives and goals
- Positive outcomes and accomplishments  
- Performance improvements and optimization gains
- User satisfaction and system effectiveness measures
- Pattern Keywords: "completed", "successful", "improved", "achieved", "optimized", "effective"

**desafios** (Challenges/Opportunities)
- Growth opportunities and potential improvements
- Strategic challenges requiring innovation
- Learning opportunities and skill development needs
- System enhancement possibilities and feature requests
- Pattern Keywords: "opportunity", "challenge", "potential", "enhancement", "could improve", "would benefit"

**errores** (Errors/Mistakes)
- Technical errors and implementation mistakes
- Process failures and execution problems
- Design flaws and architectural issues
- Quality assurance failures and regression issues
- Pattern Keywords: "error", "failed", "mistake", "broken", "bug", "incorrect", "regression"

**obstaculos** (Obstacles/Blockers)
- System limitations and technical constraints
- Resource limitations and capacity issues
- External dependencies and integration problems
- Workflow blockers and process impediments
- Pattern Keywords: "blocked", "limited", "constraint", "dependency", "impediment", "bottleneck"

**aprendizajes** (Learnings/Insights)
- Knowledge gained and insights discovered
- Best practices and pattern recognition
- Strategic insights and methodology improvements
- System understanding and architectural insights
- Pattern Keywords: "learned", "insight", "discovered", "understanding", "pattern", "principle"

## Automated Classification Algorithms

### Primary Classification Algorithm
```
1. Text Preprocessing: Normalize case, remove punctuation, tokenize
2. Keyword Matching: Score against category pattern keywords
3. Context Analysis: Analyze surrounding sentences for category indicators
4. Sentiment Analysis: Assess positive/negative/neutral tone alignment
5. Confidence Scoring: Calculate classification confidence 0.0-1.0
6. Threshold Application: Assign to category if confidence >0.6
```

### Multi-Category Classification
```
1. Apply primary algorithm to all five categories
2. Identify multiple high-confidence matches (>0.6)
3. Calculate relative confidence scores between categories
4. Assign primary category (highest confidence) + secondary categories
5. Flag complex feedback requiring manual review
```

### Pattern Recognition Enhancement
```
1. Historical Pattern Learning: Analyze past classifications for improvement
2. User-Specific Patterns: Learn individual user feedback patterns
3. Context-Aware Classification: Consider project phase and system state
4. Correlation Detection: Identify recurring category combinations
```

## Cross-Category Relationship Mapping

### Correlation Analysis Framework
**logros ↔ aprendizajes**: Achievements often generate learnings
**errores ↔ obstaculos**: Errors frequently stem from obstacles
**desafios ↔ aprendizajes**: Challenges create learning opportunities
**obstaculos ↔ desafios**: Obstacles can become growth challenges

### Relationship Strength Metrics
- **Strong Correlation** (0.8-1.0): Frequently co-occur in feedback
- **Moderate Correlation** (0.5-0.7): Sometimes related in context
- **Weak Correlation** (0.2-0.4): Occasionally connected
- **No Correlation** (0.0-0.1): Independent category occurrences

## Priority Scoring and Urgency Detection

### Category-Based Priority Weights
- **errores**: 0.9 (Critical - immediate attention required)
- **obstaculos**: 0.8 (High - blocking progress)
- **desafios**: 0.6 (Medium - growth opportunities)
- **logros**: 0.4 (Low - positive reinforcement)
- **aprendizajes**: 0.5 (Medium - strategic value)

### Urgency Detection Signals
- **Immediate**: Error patterns affecting core functionality
- **High**: Obstacles blocking multiple user workflows
- **Medium**: Challenges with clear resolution paths
- **Low**: Achievements and learnings for strategic planning

### Dynamic Priority Adjustment
```
1. Frequency Analysis: Higher frequency increases priority
2. Impact Assessment: Broader impact increases urgency
3. User Escalation: Direct user concern escalation
4. System Health: Integration with performance metrics
```
