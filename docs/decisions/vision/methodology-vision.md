# Development Methodology

**Updated**: 2025-07-25 23:13 (Mexico City) | **Authority**: Complete development philosophy | **Lines**: ≤150

## Fresh Start Reconstruction Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Complete rebuild over fragmented fixes. Preserve all valuable content while creating coherent new structure. Apply to all development work.

**When to Apply**: 
- Major architectural changes required
- Technical debt accumulation exceeds maintainability threshold
- System coherence compromised by incremental patches
- Quality degradation from fragmented development

**Implementation**: Systematic extraction → Intelligent synthesis → Complete reconstruction → Rigorous validation

## UltraThink x4 Methodology

**Definition**: Progressive layered analysis methodology applied to ALL actions using >1 tool or affecting >1 file.

**The 4 Mandatory Layers**:
- **Think (Layer 1)**: Foundation analysis → Core concepts, initial understanding, scope clarity
- **Think Hard (Layer 2)**: Deep analysis → Pattern recognition, trade-offs, dependencies  
- **Think Harder (Layer 3)**: Complex integration → Multi-system coordination, risk assessment
- **Ultra Think (Layer 4)**: Ultra synthesis → Complete solution architecture, implementation roadmap

**Universal Application**: Analysis | Planning | Implementation | Validation | All multi-step processes

## PTS Framework (Pragmatic Technical Simplicity)

**Definition**: Meta-principle governing all technical decisions. Direct, forceful, technically precise solutions with sober, concise, clear, coherent, effective, pragmatic structure.

**12 Mandatory Components**:
- Technical: Directness, Precision, Sufficiency, Excellence
- Communication: Exactitude, Sobriety, Structure, Conciseness  
- Cognitive: Clarity, Coherence, Effectiveness, Pragmatism

**Authority**: PTS is mandatory technical filter. All other principles apply ONLY after PTS fulfillment.

## Partnership Protocol Integration

**Vision Guardian Role**: Protect system vision vigilantly. Keep user focused on true objectives. Challenge inconsistencies. Demand compliance.

**Orchestration Excellence**: Deploy Task Tools as priority. Execute parallel operations. Coordinate multiple agents. Maximize efficiency through batched execution.

**Quality Enforcement**: Apply rigorous validation to every component. Test thoroughly. Research proactively. Document patterns. Evolve architecture collaboratively.

## Claude Code Orchestrated Workflow

**Universal Principle**: UltraThink x4 MUST be applied before ANY action to ensure optimal approach. Agent principal functions as ORQUESTADOR deploying specialized sub-agents via Task Tools.

### Mandatory 6-Phase Orchestrated Process

**Phase 1: Request Identification & Clarification + Initial Git Commit**
- Identify clearly the user's request with complete precision
- **Orchestration**: Deploy sub-agent for clarification if ambiguity detected
- Ask clarifying questions when any ambiguity exists  
- Ensure 100% understanding of objectives & constraints
- Map user intent to technical requirements
- **Initial Git Commit**: Commit current state before beginning work

**Phase 2: Context Exploration & Analysis via Parallel Task Tools**
- **Task Tools Deployment**: Deploy multiple specialized sub-agents for simultaneous exploration
- Explore ALL files relevant and related to user request in parallel
- Identify exactly how each file relates to the request
- Map dependencies, connections, and impact scope across multiple threads
- **Sub-agent Synthesis**: Deploy synthesis sub-agent to consolidate parallel findings
- Build comprehensive context understanding from orchestrated exploration

**Phase 3: Research & Best Practices Investigation via Parallel Task Tools**
- **Task Tools Deployment**: Deploy multiple research sub-agents for simultaneous investigation
- Conduct parallel online searches (problem resolution, best practices, case studies)
- Research current methodologies & proven approaches concurrently
- Study successful examples & implementation patterns in parallel threads
- **Sub-agent Synthesis**: Deploy synthesis sub-agent to consolidate research findings
- Gather comprehensive updated knowledge through orchestrated investigation

**Phase 4: UltraThink x4 Solution Architecture + Success Criteria + Plan Analysis**
- **4A: UltraThink x4 Solution Design**: Apply complete 4-layer analysis to design step-by-step plan focusing on root causes
- **4B: Success Criteria Definition**: Deploy specialized sub-agent to define multi-dimensional success criteria (quantitative metrics, qualitative evaluations, visual verification requirements)
- **4C: Plan Analysis Validation**: Deploy specialized sub-agent to apply UltraThink x4 analysis to proposed plan (coherence validation, risk detection, optimization identification)
- **Orchestration**: Main agent coordinates and synthesizes outputs from specialized sub-agents
- Create comprehensive solution architecture with validation framework

**Phase 5: Planning & Tracking Setup via Parallel Task Tools**
- **Task Tools Deployment**: Deploy sub-agents for parallel tracking system preparation
- Load detailed steps into TodoWrite for progress tracking
- Establish clear milestones & success criteria integration
- **Parallel Setup**: Monitoring systems, validation frameworks, modification protocols
- Set up orchestrated plan modification & iteration protocols

**Phase 6: Orchestrated Execution + Multi-Dimensional Validation + Improvement Loop + Final Commit + User Evolution Capture**
- **Central Orchestration**: Main agent coordinates specialized sub-agents for parallel execution
- **Task Tools Deployment**: Deploy sub-agents for simultaneous execution of independent tasks
- **Specialized Sub-agents**: Document writing, code development, testing, validation
- **Execution Monitoring**: Step-by-step progress with orchestrated tracking
- **Multi-Dimensional Validation**: 
  - **Quantitative**: Deploy sub-agents for metrics calculation & measurement
  - **Qualitative**: Deploy sub-agents for functionality & quality assessment
  - **Visual**: Deploy sub-agents for screenshot capture & visual verification
- **Sub-agent Synthesis**: Consolidate validation results from parallel assessments
- **Improvement Loop**: If success criteria not met → coordinate parallel improvements (maximum 5 iterations)
- **Final Git Commit**: Only after complete validation success through orchestrated verification
- **User Evolution Capture**: Auto-trigger interview to capture user insights from session → user-input/evolution/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-session.md

**Compliance**: This orchestrated workflow is MANDATORY for ALL Claude Code interactions. No exceptions.

## Orchestration Principles

**Main Agent Role**: Orchestrator coordinating specialized sub-agents via Task Tools
**Sub-agent Role**: Specialized executors with focused expertise areas
**Task Tools**: Primary deployment mechanism for parallel sub-agent coordination
**Default Mode**: Parallelization whenever possible (assume independence, design for concurrency)
**Synthesis Requirement**: Always deploy synthesis sub-agents to consolidate parallel outputs

**Methodology Vision**: Orchestrated excellence through parallel Task Tools deployment, specialized sub-agent coordination, and systematic validation.
