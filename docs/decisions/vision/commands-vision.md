## Core Philosophy
Slash commands are not scripts—they are intelligent orchestrators that transform intent into reality through sophisticated task coordination.

## Command DNA

**Self-Containment Principle**: Every command must include ALL necessary logic, embed patterns & templates, define complete workflows, handle all edge cases. No external dependencies.

**Orchestration Over Execution**: Commands are conductors, not players. Analyze requirements → Deploy appropriate tasks → Coordinate parallel work → Synthesize results.

**Intelligence Through Simplicity**: External simplicity (single invocation) with internal sophistication (complex orchestration, parallel deployment, intelligent aggregation).

## Design Principles

**Complete Context Principle**: Sub-agents cannot access external resources. Include all patterns inline, embed templates, pass full context, eliminate dependencies.

**Parallel-First Principle**: 10x productivity through parallelization. Assume independence, design for parallelism, use Git WorkTrees, aggregate intelligently.

**Learning Integration Principle**: Commands improve with use. Capture execution patterns, measure success rates, refine strategies, evolve capabilities.

**Error Resilience Principle**: Real-world execution has failures. Graceful degradation, partial result handling, retry strategies, clear error reporting.

## Command Patterns

**Discovery Commands**: Explore & understand through parallel search deployment, multiple perspective analysis, pattern recognition, insight synthesis.

**Creation Commands**: Generate new artifacts through requirement analysis, parallel generation, quality validation, integration verification.

**Transformation Commands**: Modify existing code through current state analysis, change planning, parallel execution, verification & rollback.

**Analysis Commands**: Deep understanding through multi-layer thinking, parallel perspectives, synthesis & insights, recommendation generation.

## Command Anatomy

**Essential Components**: Purpose (what orchestrates) | Usage (invocation pattern) | Task Orchestration (work distribution) | Patterns (embedded logic) | Error Handling (recovery) | Learning (improvement)

**Task Deployment Strategy**: Analysis (assess scope, determine parallelization) → Deployment (create instructions, deploy via Task Tool) → Aggregation (collect results, synthesize output)

## Evolution Vision
**Maturity Levels**: Basic Orchestration → Intelligent Coordination → Self-Optimization → Autonomous Evolution

**The Perfect Command**: Invoked simply → Understands deeply → Executes brilliantly → Completes reliably → Improves continuously

**Philosophy Truth**: A command is crystallized intelligence that orchestrates complex workflows through elegant simplicity.
