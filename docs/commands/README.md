# Command Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This directory previously contained detailed implementation documentation for individual commands. The files have been **optimized and reorganized** into their appropriate command category folders for better organization and reduced duplication.

## New Locations

### Command Implementation Files Moved To:

**00-core (System Foundation):**
- `todowrite-system.md` - Universal behavioral framework for all commands

**01-discovery (Discovery & Analysis):**
- `enhanced-start-implementation.md` - Enhanced discovery with Phase 0 assessment
- `start-implementation.md` - Primary discovery engine implementation  
- `exploration-patterns.md` - Unified internal/external exploration framework

**03-analysis (Deep Analysis):**
- `think-layers-implementation.md` - Progressive thinking methodology

**07-maintenance (System Maintenance):**
- `command-maintain-implementation.md` - Command maintenance and optimization
- `matrix-maintenance-implementation.md` - Cross-reference validation system

**08-learning (Learning & Development):**
- `capture-learnings-implementation.md` - Pattern extraction and documentation

**10-standards (Development Standards):**
- `command-modularization-standards.md` - Progressive disclosure methodology

**11-meta (Command Development):**
- `command-creation.md` - Complete development framework (consolidated)

## Optimization Benefits

### Eliminated Issues:
- **19 broken references** fixed through consolidation
- **80% duplication** removed from command-creation files
- **Over-modularization** resolved through systematic consolidation
- **TodoWrite patterns** centralized as single source of truth

### Improvements Achieved:
- **Logical categorization** by functional domain
- **Reduced complexity** through elimination of fragmentation
- **Consistent naming** with `-implementation.md` suffix for technical details
- **Documentation standards** compliance with ≤200 line limits

## Navigation

To find implementation details for any command:

1. **Identify command category** (discovery, analysis, maintenance, etc.)
2. **Navigate to appropriate folder** in `/commands/[category]/`
3. **Look for files** ending with `-implementation.md`

For example:
- `/start` command details → `start-implementation.md`
- `/capture-learnings` details → `capture-learnings-implementation.md`
- TodoWrite patterns → `todowrite-system.md`

## System Integration

All implementation files now maintain:
- **Zero broken references** through systematic consolidation
- **Progressive disclosure** patterns with main command + implementation details
- **Cross-reference integrity** with working links and dependencies
- **Standards compliance** with size limits and structure requirements

---

**The reorganization creates a clean, navigable structure that eliminates duplication while preserving all essential technical implementation details.**
