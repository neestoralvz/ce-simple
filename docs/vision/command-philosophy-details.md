### Task Deployment Section
```yaml
Task Strategy:
  Analysis:
    - Assess scope
    - Determine parallelization
    - Plan task distribution
    
  Deployment:
    - Create task instructions
    - Include full context
    - Deploy via Task Tool
    
  Aggregation:
    - Collect results
    - Resolve conflicts
    - Synthesize output
```

## üèóÔ∏è Design Principles - Complete Specifications

### 1. Complete Context Principle
```yaml
Why: Sub-agents can't access external resources
How:
  - Include all patterns inline
  - Embed templates in commands
  - Pass full context to tasks
  - No external dependencies
```

### 2. Parallel-First Principle
```yaml
Why: 10x productivity through parallelization
How:
  - Assume independence
  - Design for parallelism
  - Use Git WorkTrees
  - Aggregate intelligently
```

### 3. Learning Integration Principle
```yaml
Why: Commands should improve with use
How:
  - Capture execution patterns
  - Measure success rates
  - Refine strategies
  - Evolve capabilities
```

### 4. Error Resilience Principle
```yaml
Why: Real-world execution has failures
How:
  - Graceful degradation
  - Partial result handling
  - Retry strategies
  - Clear error reporting
```

## üí° Command Best Practices - Expanded Guidelines

### DO:
- **Make self-contained**: Everything needed included
- **Design for parallelism**: Default to concurrent
- **Handle failures**: Graceful degradation
- **Learn from execution**: Continuous improvement
- **Document clearly**: Purpose and usage obvious

### DON'T:
- **Assume context**: Be explicit always
- **Create dependencies**: Stay self-contained
- **Ignore errors**: Handle all cases
- **Overcomplicate**: Simple interface
- **Forget testing**: Validate thoroughly

## üåü The Command Ideal

The perfect command:
1. **Invoked simply**: `/command-name`
2. **Understands deeply**: Through embedded intelligence
3. **Executes brilliantly**: Via parallel orchestration
4. **Completes reliably**: With error handling
5. **Improves continuously**: Through learning
