# Task Orchestration Architecture

## 🎼 Core Architecture

The Task Tool is Claude Code's mechanism for creating sub-agents that execute work in parallel, transforming slash commands from simple scripts into powerful workflow orchestrators.

## 🛠️ Task Tool Capabilities

### Technical Specifications
- **Concurrent Limit**: Up to 10 sub-agents
- **Tool Access**: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash
- **Restrictions**: No Task Tool access, no slash command invocation
- **Execution Model**: True parallelism with independent contexts

### Sub-Agent Architecture
```yaml
Sub-Agent Properties:
  - Independent execution context
  - Full tool access (except Task)
  - Cannot see other sub-agents
  - Cannot access parent context
  - Must receive complete instructions
```

## 🎯 Orchestration Patterns

### Primary Patterns
- **Seven-Parallel-Tasks**: Component development (7x speedup)
- **Scatter-Gather**: Information collection and synthesis
- **Wave Deployment**: Multi-stage complex workflows
- **Competitive Redundancy**: Critical operations reliability

See [task-orchestration-details.md](task-orchestration-details.md) for complete pattern specifications and implementation examples.

## 📋 Task Instruction Framework

### Key Components
- **Clear Task Name**: Single focused objective
- **Complete Context**: All necessary background
- **Structured Steps**: Specific actionable items
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes
- **Output Format**: Consistent structured results

### Common Pitfalls
- Vague instructions
- Missing context
- No success criteria
- Assumed knowledge

See [task-orchestration-details.md](task-orchestration-details.md) for complete instruction templates and examples.

## 🚀 Advanced Techniques

### Core Techniques
- **Git WorkTree Integration**: Conflict-free parallel development
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar operations for efficiency
- **Dynamic Task Generation**: Create tasks based on discovery

See [task-orchestration-details.md](task-orchestration-details.md) for complete implementation details and advanced strategies.

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### Core Guidelines
- Always parallel first
- Batch wisely
- Limit scope
- Clear boundaries

### Resource Management
- 10-task limit with queuing
- Token efficiency focus
- Time boxing approach
- Error budget planning

See [task-orchestration-details.md](task-orchestration-details.md) for detailed optimization strategies and metrics.

## 🎭 Real-World Applications

### Success Stories
- **Large-Scale Refactoring**: 4 hours → 15 minutes (50 files)
- **Bug Hunt Operations**: 2 days → 30 minutes (parallel testing)
- **Feature Development**: 1 week → 1 day (concurrent creation)

See [task-orchestration-details.md](task-orchestration-details.md) for complete case study breakdowns and metrics.

## 💡 Best Practices

### Command Design
1. Plan parallelization upfront
2. Design clear task boundaries
3. Standardize output formats
4. Build aggregation logic
5. Handle partial failures

### Task Instructions
1. Complete context always
2. Explicit success criteria
3. Structured output format
4. Error handling guidance
5. No external dependencies

### Result Processing
1. Validate all outputs
2. Handle contradictions
3. Merge intelligently
4. Extract patterns
5. Learn from execution

See [task-orchestration-details.md](task-orchestration-details.md) for expanded best practices and implementation guides.
