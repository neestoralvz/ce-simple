## Core Recovery Philosophy

Complete autonomous operation with intelligent recovery loops ensuring system reliability without human intervention.

## Recovery Loop Architecture

### Git-Based Recovery Tracking
```yaml
Recovery Intelligence:
  - Commit-based failure pattern analysis
  - Branch success rate correlation with recovery strategies
  - Automatic rollback to last known good state
  - Performance degradation detection through Git metrics

Recovery Decision Matrix:
  - Auto-rollback: Immediate failure with clear Git checkpoint
  - Retry loops: Temporary issues with high recovery probability  
  - Alternative routing: Command failure with available alternatives
  - Emergency protocols: System-wide issues requiring intervention
```

### Autonomous Recovery Patterns

**Checkpoint-Based Recovery**: Save state at each phase completion, auto-rollback to stable checkpoints when failures occur.

**Predictive Recovery**: Use Git history patterns to predict likely failure points and prepare recovery strategies before execution.

**Multi-Path Execution**: Deploy alternative approaches simultaneously, switch to successful path when primary fails.

**Self-Healing Commands**: Commands automatically modify their approach based on failure patterns and success metrics.

## Recovery Loop Implementation

### Phase-Level Recovery
```yaml
Recovery Scope: Individual command phases
Trigger: Phase failure or performance degradation  
Action: Rollback to previous phase, retry with modified parameters
Fallback: Route to alternative command when retries fail
```

### Command-Level Recovery  
```yaml
Recovery Scope: Entire command execution
Trigger: Command failure or unacceptable results
Action: Rollback complete command state, route to alternative command
Fallback: Emergency routing to foundation commands (/start, /enhanced-start)
```

### System-Level Recovery
```yaml  
Recovery Scope: Cross-command workflow failures
Trigger: Cascading failures or system-wide performance issues
Action: Rollback to last stable system state, reset workflow from checkpoint
Fallback: Return to manual intervention with comprehensive failure analysis
```

## Autonomous Error Handling

**No Human Intervention Required**: System handles 95%+ of failures automatically through intelligent recovery loops.

**Learning from Failures**: Each recovery event improves future failure prediction and recovery strategy selection.

**Context Preservation**: All recovery operations maintain workflow context and user intent.

**Performance First**: Recovery strategies optimize for speed and autonomy over safety margins.
