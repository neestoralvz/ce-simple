# Task Orchestration Details

## ðŸŽ¯ Orchestration Patterns - Complete Specifications

### Git-Based Intelligence System
Orchestration driven by Git metrics and autonomous decision making:
```yaml
Intelligence Sources:
  - Commit patterns and success indicators
  - Branch lifecycle and merge success rates
  - File change patterns correlating with efficiency
  - Performance timeline data from Git history

Autonomous Decisions:
  - Optimal command sequence selection
  - Resource allocation based on historical data
  - Recovery strategy selection from past patterns
  - New command creation triggers from usage analysis
```

### 1. Seven-Parallel-Tasks Pattern
The most efficient pattern for component development:
```yaml
Tasks:
  1. Component creation
  2. Styles/CSS
  3. Tests
  4. Type definitions
  5. Hooks/utilities
  6. Integration updates
  7. Documentation

Execution: All in parallel
Result: 7x speedup
```

### 2. Scatter-Gather Pattern
For information collection and synthesis:
```yaml
Scatter Phase:
  - Deploy multiple search tasks
  - Different strategies per task
  - Explore various paths

Gather Phase:
  - Collect all results
  - Synthesize findings
  - Identify patterns
```

### 3. Wave Deployment Pattern
For complex multi-stage workflows:
```yaml
Wave 1: Discovery
  - Parallel exploration
  - Context gathering

Wave 2: Analysis
  - Process discoveries
  - Apply think layers

Wave 3: Creation
  - Generate solutions
  - Parallel development

Wave 4: Validation
  - Test all outputs
  - Verify success
```

### 4. Competitive Redundancy Pattern
For critical operations needing reliability:
```yaml
Strategy:
  - Multiple agents same task
  - Different approaches
  - Compare results
  - Select best outcome
```

## ðŸ“‹ Task Instruction Templates

### Effective Task Instructions
```markdown
## Task: [Clear Task Name]

### Objective
[Single clear goal]

### Context
[All necessary background]

### Steps
1. [Specific action]
2. [Specific action]
3. [Specific action]

### Success Criteria
- [Measurable outcome]
- [Expected format]

### Output Format
```yaml
result:
  status: success/failure
  data: [structured data]
  summary: [brief description]
```
```

## ðŸš€ Advanced Techniques - Implementation Details

### Git WorkTree Integration
```yaml
Purpose: Conflict-free parallel development
Implementation:
  - Create worktree per task
  - Isolate file operations
  - Merge after completion
  - Clean integration
```

### Batch Processing
```yaml
Strategy: Group similar operations
Benefits:
  - Reduced overhead
  - Better resource usage
  - Cleaner aggregation
Example:
  - Batch all searches
  - Batch all file edits
  - Batch all validations
```

### Dynamic Task Generation
```yaml
Concept: Create tasks based on discovery
Flow:
  1. Initial exploration task
  2. Analyze findings
  3. Generate specific tasks
  4. Deploy dynamically
```

## ðŸ“Š Performance Optimization - Detailed Strategies

### Parallelization Guidelines
- **Always parallel first**: Assume independence
- **Batch wisely**: Group related operations
- **Limit scope**: Focused tasks perform better
- **Clear boundaries**: No overlapping responsibilities

### Resource Management
- **10-task limit**: Queue if exceeded
- **Token efficiency**: Minimal instructions, maximum clarity
- **Time boxing**: Set reasonable timeouts
- **Error budgets**: Plan for failures

## ðŸŽ­ Real-World Applications - Case Studies

### Large-Scale Refactoring
- 50 files touched
- 7 parallel analysis tasks
- 10 parallel modification tasks
- 4 hours â†’ 15 minutes

### Bug Hunt Operations
- Multiple search strategies
- Parallel hypothesis testing
- Concurrent fix attempts
- 2 days â†’ 30 minutes

### Feature Development
- Component creation in parallel
- Test writing concurrent
- Documentation alongside
- 1 week â†’ 1 day

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices - Implementation Guides

### Command Design
1. **Plan parallelization upfront**
2. **Design clear task boundaries**
3. **Standardize output formats**
4. **Build aggregation logic**
5. **Handle partial failures**

### Task Instructions
1. **Complete context always**
2. **Explicit success criteria**
3. **Structured output format**
4. **Error handling guidance**
5. **No external dependencies**

### Result Processing
1. **Validate all outputs**
2. **Handle contradictions**
3. **Merge intelligently**
4. **Extract patterns**
5. **Learn from execution**
