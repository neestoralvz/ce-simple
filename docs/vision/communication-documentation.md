# Communication Documentation

**Updated**: 2025-07-26 12:00 (Mexico City) | **Authority**: Documentation & communication philosophy | **Lines**: ≤80

## Core Documentation Philosophy
Create clear, actionable documentation optimized for Claude Code agent deployment with maximum information density while maintaining clarity.

## Three-Layer Architecture Vision

**Layer Structure**: 
- **Foundation** (≤50 lines): Essential concepts as agent prompts (cognitive load optimized)
- **Implementation** (≤100 lines): Detailed procedures for agent deployment (context economy)
- **Validation** (≤100 lines): Quality gates & checklists for agent validation (focused compliance)

**Zero Duplication Principle**: One specialized file per concept. Layer separation prevents overlap.

## Communication Standards

**English-Only Protocol**: Zero tolerance for mixed language. Spanish found → understand → recreate in English. Consistency across all documentation & commands.

**Direct Technical Style**: Technical, professional, no marketing language. Imperative tone for instructions using command verbs (Apply, Use, Execute, Implement).

**Maximum Value Density**: Contributing words only | Action verbs | Zero redundancy | References over inline content.

## Context Compaction Techniques

**Core Methods**: Header compression (### → **Label**:) | Symbol substitution (and → &, → →, ≤) | Pipe separation for lists | Reference consolidation (@path/to/details) | Smart line breaks for related content

**Quality Preservation Priority**: Content quality & value preservation supersedes line limits. Never eliminate valuable content for compression. When compaction risks content loss → file division required.

**Application Guidelines**: Component extraction first → Traditional compaction → File division as final option.

## Agent-Deployable Architecture

**Foundation → Implementation → Validation Coordination**: Documentation structured for systematic agent deployment with clear coordination patterns.

**Conditional Context System**: Enhanced conditional loading with workflow triggers. IF condition → READ docs/path/file.md:lines for specific situations.

**Agent Specialization**: When deploying agents → Provide clear specialization area + specific objective + sufficient context + relevant files + complete background.

## Anti-Bias Enforcement
Objective criteria | Measurable standards | Agnostic tone | Zero marketing embellishments | Technical precision over persuasion.

## Success Metrics
**Density Ratio**: ≥2:1 compression without loss | **Agent Deployment**: 100% successful coordination | **Comprehension**: ≤30% time increase | **Reference Efficiency**: ≤3 hops to details

**Documentation Vision**: Agent-deployable excellence through systematic three-layer architecture with maximum information density.
