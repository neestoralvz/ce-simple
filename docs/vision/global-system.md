# Global System

**Updated**: 2025-07-26 12:00 (Mexico City) | **Authority**: Global command & governance vision | **Lines**: ≤80

## Global Command Architecture
Comprehensive system of 86+ autocontained slash commands organized in 15 functional categories (00-14) ready for deployment to any project's global command directory.

## Command Categories Vision

**00-core**: Foundation Infrastructure (7 commands) - Essential operations & primary entry points
**01-discovery**: Exploration & Analysis (5 commands) - Requirements understanding & technical analysis  
**02-planning**: Strategic Planning (8 commands) - Vision-driven development & strategic workflows
**03-analysis**: Assessment & Evaluation (6 commands) - Technical complexity evaluation & frameworks
**04-execution**: Implementation & Orchestration (5 commands) - Active development & parallel coordination
**05-validation**: Quality Assurance (8 commands) - Comprehensive validation ensuring correctness
**06-documentation**: Documentation Management (2 commands) - Documentation maintenance & consistency
**07-maintenance**: System Health (2 commands) - System optimization & maintenance operations
**08-learning**: Continuous Improvement (5 commands) - Pattern extraction & system optimization
**09-git**: Version Control Orchestration (5 commands) - Advanced Git operations & workflow management
**10-standards**: Development Guidelines (5 commands) - Standards, templates & development guidelines
**11-meta**: System Management (5 commands) - Command development & maintenance operations  
**12-math**: Mathematical Operations (6 commands) - Mathematical calculation & computation engines
**13-search**: Information Discovery (5 commands) - Advanced search with intelligent filtering
**14-utils**: Utility Engines (9 commands) - Core utility engines providing specialized functionality

## Governance Architecture

**Nomenclature Standards**: 
- **Rules**: Governance protocols for behavior (docs/rules/)
- **Standards**: Technical specifications for implementation (docs/standards/)
- **Commands**: verb-noun pattern for slash commands
- **Files**: topic-type.md pattern (lowercase-hyphenated)

**Authority Hierarchy**: docs/vision/ (absolute) → CLAUDE_RULES.md (partnership) → docs/core/ (technical) → CLAUDE.md (navigation)

**Flat Structure Principle**: Maximum 1 directory level. Create when needed (no empty directories). Single purpose per file. Active use only.

## System Integration Vision

**Clean Boundaries**: Self-contained commands referencing each other via slash calls only. Preventing dependency conflicts through architectural isolation.

**Cross-Domain Operation**: Web development, research, documentation, office work, tenders, general workflow automation.

**Quality Compliance**: All commands meet PTS 12-component framework. ≤80 lines per command. Complete error handling & user guidance.

**Global Vision**: Universal command system with clean architecture enabling sophisticated workflow automation across all domains.
