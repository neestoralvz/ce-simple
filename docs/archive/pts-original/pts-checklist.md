## ðŸš« PTS Blocking Criteria

**Any of these elements PREVENTS proceeding:**

### Critical Blocking
- **No clear purpose** - Cannot justify the need
- **Multiple responsibilities** - Fundamentally violates SRP
- **Unnecessary complexity** - Simpler solution exists
- **Not reusable** - Only useful in specific case
- **Not maintainable** - Requires specialized knowledge to modify

### Quality Blocking
- **No direct verification** - Cannot be tested effectively
- **Complex documentation** - Requires extensive explanation
- **Inadequate performance** - Doesn't meet basic requirements
- **Poor error handling** - Errors not informative or without recovery
- **Breaks conventions** - Inconsistent with ecosystem

### Architecture Blocking
- **No SSOT** - Data duplicated without justification
- **Forced integration** - No natural fit with system
- **Evolution blocked** - Future changes require major refactoring

## ðŸ”„ PTS Validation Process

### Phase 1: Pre-evaluation (2 minutes)
1. **Elevator Pitch Test**: Can it be explained in 30 seconds?
2. **Single Purpose Test**: Does it do exactly one thing?
3. **Simplicity Test**: Is it the simplest possible solution?

**If any test fails â†’ STOP â†’ Redesign**

### Phase 2: Complete Evaluation (10 minutes)
1. **Execute complete 12-component checklist**
2. **Verify absence of blocking criteria**
3. **Document decisions and trade-offs**

**If any component fails â†’ STOP â†’ Document reason â†’ Redesign**

### Phase 3: Contextual Validation (5 minutes)
1. **Verify fit with tier 1-5 principles**
2. **Confirm alignment with docs/vision/**
3. **Validate consistency with existing system**

**If contextual validation fails â†’ STOP â†’ Evaluate systemic impact**

## ðŸ“Š Context-Specific Application Matrix

### PTS for Commands
**Specific focus:**
- Purpose: Unique and clear workflow
- Implementation: Self-contained logic
- Reusability: Applicable to multiple projects
- Verification: Predictable and measurable output

**Command validation:**
```bash
# Quick PTS test for commands
- What workflow does it solve? (30 seconds)
- Does it work without configuration? (KISS)
- Is output evident? (Direct verification)
- Is it self-contained? (No external dependencies)
```

### PTS for Documentation
**Specific focus:**
- Purpose: Specific and actionable information
- Implementation: Clear and navigable structure
- Reusability: Applicable patterns
- Verification: Immediately evident utility

**Documentation validation:**
```bash
# Quick PTS test for docs
- What question does it answer? (Clear purpose)
- Is it understood without additional context? (Self-evident)
- Does it have practical examples? (Direct verification)
- Can it be applied immediately? (Pragmatism)
```

### PTS for Code
**Specific focus:**
- Purpose: Well-defined specific function
- Implementation: Clean and direct code
- Reusability: Composable modules
- Verification: Simple and obvious tests

**Code validation:**
```bash
# Quick PTS test for code
- What exactly does it do? (Single responsibility)
- Does name fully describe function? (Self-evident)
- Can it be tested in isolation? (Direct verification)
- Is API stable? (Controlled evolution)
```

### PTS for Architecture
**Specific focus:**
- Purpose: Structure that facilitates development
- Implementation: Clear separation of responsibilities
- Reusability: Stable architectural patterns
- Verification: Evident quality metrics

**Architecture validation:**
```bash
# Quick PTS test for architecture

- Does it facilitate or complicate development? (Technical simplicity)
- Is it evident how to use it? (Pragmatism)
- Does it scale naturally? (Controlled evolution)
```

## ðŸ”— Integration with Existing Principles

### PTS modifies SOLID application:
- **SRP + PTS**: One clear responsibility AND pragmatically useful
- **OCP + PTS**: Extensible in simple and evident way
- **LSP + PTS**: Substitution without additional complexity
- **ISP + PTS**: Specific interfaces AND easy to use
- **DIP + PTS**: Pragmatic abstractions, not theoretical

### PTS modifies DRY application:
- **Classic DRY**: Don't repeat code
- **DRY + PTS**: Don't repeat knowledge, with pragmatism
- **Criteria**: If eliminating duplication adds significant complexity, evaluate trade-off

### PTS modifies YAGNI application:
- **Classic YAGNI**: Don't implement until necessary
- **YAGNI + PTS**: Don't implement until pragmatically valuable
- **Criteria**: Need must be evident and immediate, not speculative

## ðŸŽ¯ System Implementation

### Application Order
1. **PTS Tier 0** - Mandatory primary filter
2. **Tier 1-5 Principles** - Applied only if passes PTS
3. **Specific context** - Final validation

### Development Flow
```yaml
Idea/Requirement:
  -> PTS Pre-evaluation (2 min)
  -> If passes: PTS Complete Evaluation (10 min)  
  -> If passes: PTS Contextual Validation (5 min)
  -> If passes: Apply Tier 1-5 principles
  -> Implement
```

### PTS Success Metrics
- **Comprehension time**: <5 minutes to understand completely
- **Usage time**: <2 minutes to use effectively
- **Modification time**: <15 minutes for typical changes
- **Reusability**: Used in >3 different contexts
- **Maintenance**: <30 minutes/month average maintenance

---

**Fundamental Principle**: PTS is the mandatory filter that ensures we only develop solutions that are simultaneously simple, technically sound, and pragmatically valuable.

**Application**: Every system element must pass PTS before any other consideration - it's the foundation that enables architectural excellence without over-engineering.
