# Maintenance and Versioning

Ongoing maintenance procedures for the export system.

## Updating the Export
When commands are updated in ce-simple:

1. Re-run export script: `python3 scripts/export_commands.py`
2. Validate: `cd export && python3 validate_export.py`
3. Create new distribution: `bash scripts/create_distribution.sh`
4. Distribute updated package

## Version Management
Update version in `scripts/create_distribution.sh`:
```bash
VERSION="1.1.0"  # Increment as needed
```
