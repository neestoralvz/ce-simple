# Usage Patterns

Common command sequences and workflow examples.

## Basic Session Flow
1. `/workflows:start` - Begin with context and priorities
2. Use appropriate commands based on priorities
3. `/workflows:close` - End with handoff preparation

## Research-Heavy Tasks
1. `/actions:research` - Gather current information
2. `/roles:partner` - Validate findings and decisions
3. `/actions:build` - Create documentation or implementation

## System Maintenance
1. `/maintenance:maintain` - Check system health
2. `/roles:challenge` - Validate against anti-patterns
3. `/actions:recreate` - Rebuild components if needed

## Customization

All commands can be customized by:
- Modifying context references in command files
- Adjusting templates and patterns
- Updating validation criteria
- Adding project-specific triggers
