# First Session

Walk through your first experience with the command system.

## 1. Start Your Session
```
/workflows:start
```
This will:
- Read your project state
- Show current priorities  
- Suggest next steps

## 2. Try a Research Task  
```
/actions:research
```
Ask it to research something relevant to your project to test the concurrent search capabilities.

## 3. Test Orchestration
```
/roles:orchestrator
```
Give it a multi-step task to see the delegation and continuous execution in action.

## 4. End with Handoff
```
/workflows:close  
```
This will capture your session progress for next time.

## What to Expect

- **Continuous execution** without confirmation prompts
- **Parallel operations** when possible
- **Think x4 analysis** for systematic reasoning
- **Intelligent delegation** to specialized tools
