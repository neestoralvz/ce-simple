# Methodology Enforcement

Systematic execution and quality standards.

## Continuous Execution OBLIGATORIO
**Template**: "Completed [SUBTASK] → [RESULT]. Auto-continuing with [NEXT] (progress: X/Y)."
**NEVER pause** after notifications waiting for confirmation
**Continue automatically** until task list empty OR user explicitly says STOP

## Think x4 SIEMPRE
**OBLIGATORY apply** Think x4 in analysis and proposals
**NEVER use** "instinct", "intuition" without systematic analysis
**Template**: Think 1-4 explicit perspectives before conclusion

## Parallel Tools OBLIGATORIO
**Web searches** ALWAYS concurrent when researching
**Batch operations** for independent information obligatory
**Multiple simultaneous tools** in single message when possible

## Post-Validation Sistemática
**After each delegation** → automatic second Task tool
**Verify alignment** context/TRUTH_SOURCE.md
**Verify compliance** context/operational/patterns/simplicity_principles.md
**Verify standards** according to appropriate context

**Quality principle**: Systematic execution ensures consistent high-quality results.
