Conditional loading patterns for different operational modes.

## Context Loading Patterns
**Context loading seg√∫n patterns**:
- Research: context/operational/behaviors/discovery_execution_flow.md + context/operational/patterns/
- Documentation: context/system/templates/ + context/operational/patterns/documentation_style.md  
- Architecture: context/TRUTH_SOURCE.md + context/operational/patterns/authority_framework.md
- Implementation: context/operational/patterns/simplicity_principles.md + context/operational/behaviors/
- Commands: context/system/templates/ + context/operational/patterns/
- Validation: context/operational/enforcement/quality_gates.md + context/operational/behaviors/

## Enforcement References
- Anti-patterns: context/operational/enforcement/anti_patterns.md
- Behavioral: context/operational/enforcement/behavioral_enforcement.md
- Quality gates: context/operational/enforcement/quality_gates.md

## Core Principle
**PRINCIPIO ESENCIAL**: Semantic recognition + Think x4 + delegation + continuous execution + systematic validation = Maximum completeness with zero friction.

**AUTO-SETUP**: This system automatically creates its required context structure on first use, then operates as a fully-featured project intelligence dispatcher using global commands with local context awareness.

**Smart loading**: Context loads dynamically based on operational patterns and user needs.
