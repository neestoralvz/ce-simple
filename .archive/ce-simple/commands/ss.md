# Start System - Claude Code Slash Command

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
System entry point that activates pragmatic command system with Task tool orchestration for specialized agent deployment.

## ðŸš€ Usage
Execute: `/ss`

Provides:
1. **System Status** - Available commands and functionality
2. **Agent Orchestration** - Specialized agent deployment for all subsequent commands
3. **Quick Validation** - System integrity verification
4. **Next Steps** - Clear usage guidance

## âœ… Quick Test
1. Execute `/ss`
2. System status displayed in <5 seconds
3. Orchestration mode activated
4. Ready for specialized command execution

## ðŸ”§ Implementation

### Instructions for Claude Code
When executing this command:

1. **System Status Check**:
   - Use `/list-commands` to get current available commands
   - Verify system files and integrity
   - Display functional commands count

2. **Activate Orchestration Mode**:
   - Enable Task tool deployment for all subsequent commands
   - Prepare command detection patterns
   - Ready specialized agent deployment protocol

3. **Display System Information**:
   ```
   ðŸŽ¯ PRAGMATIC COMMANDS SYSTEM - ORCHESTRATION MODE ACTIVE
   ðŸ“Š Status: [X] commands functional | System: âœ… READY
   ðŸ¤– Mode: SPECIALIZED AGENT DEPLOYMENT
   ðŸš€ Ready for command execution via orchestrated agents
   ```

## ðŸ¤– Task Tool Orchestration

### Command Detection Patterns
- **Validation**: "validate", "check", "verify", "review" â†’ `/validate-file`
- **Creation**: "create", "generate", "new", "make" â†’ `/create-command`
- **Listing**: "list", "show", "display", "all" â†’ `/list-commands`  
- **Exploration**: "find", "search", "explore", "discover" â†’ `/explore-code`
- **Standards**: "format", "style", "standards", "writing" â†’ `/writing-standards`
- **Synchronization**: "sync", "update", "synchronize", "coherent" â†’ `/sync-docs`

### Agent Deployment Protocol
When command detected:
1. **Task Tool Deployment**:
   - **Description**: "Execute [command-name]"
   - **Prompt**: "You are a specialized agent. Execute `/command-name [args]` with full context. Follow all specifications exactly and return structured results."

2. **Integration**: Receive specialized agent results and present to user with orchestrator context

### Orchestration Examples
```
User: "validate my CLAUDE.md"
â†’ Task deploys agent with "/validate-file CLAUDE.md"

User: "create analysis command"  
â†’ Task deploys agent with "/create-command analysis"

User: "list all commands"
â†’ Task deploys agent with "/list-commands"
```

## âš¡ Triggers

### Input Triggers
- **Context**: User needs system activation or command execution
- **Keywords**: start, begin, activate, system, help, commands

### Output Triggers  
- **Next Action**: Any command request â†’ Deploy specialized agent via Task tool
- **Workflow**: ss â†’ [specialized-command-via-agent] â†’ integrated-results
