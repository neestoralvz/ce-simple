## 🔧 Core Principles

### 0. System Coherence Paramount
- **Before any operation**: Verify coherence impact
- **During execution**: Monitor coherence continuously
- **After changes**: Validate system integrity
- **Emergency threshold**: <70% coherence triggers immediate repair

### 1. Universal Orchestrator Rules
- **Pure coordination**: Never execute directly, always delegate
- **Parallel optimization**: Simultaneous operations when possible
- **Mathematical verification**: Real tool metrics only
- **Template compliance**: Follow standard structures

### 2. Hierarchical Communication
```
📊 [LX:TYPE] ACTION | DATA | METRICS
```

## 📊 Mathematical Verification

**Compact Format (Standard)**:
```
📊 [LX:TYPE] MathVer | Tool: wc -l *.md → 1,247 lines | Precision: 94.2% | VALID | CTX:75%
```

**Detailed Format (Reports)**:
```
📊 MATHEMATICAL VERIFICATION (REAL TOOL USE)
├── Tool executed: [actual command]
├── Raw output: [unprocessed result]
├── Calculation: [formula with values]
├── State: VALID/INVALID (tool-verified)
```
