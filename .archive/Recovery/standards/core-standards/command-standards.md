# Command Development Standards

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Requirements

Every slash command MUST be:
1. **Self-contained**: All logic included
2. **Orchestration-focused**: Commands coordinate, tasks execute
3. **Parallel-optimized**: Default to concurrent execution
4. **Error-resilient**: Handle all failure modes
5. **Learning-enabled**: Improve with use

## ðŸ“‹ Command Structure

### Required Sections

```markdown
# command-name

## Purpose
[Single paragraph describing what this command orchestrates]

## Usage
```
/command-name [required-param] [optional-param]
```

## Parameters
- `required-param`: Description
- `optional-param`: Description (default: value)

## Task Orchestration
[Detailed orchestration strategy]

## Error Handling
[How failures are managed]

## Performance
[Expected execution time and parallelization]

## Examples
[Real usage examples with expected outcomes]
```

### Task Orchestration Section

Must include:
```yaml
Strategy:
  - Task distribution plan
  - Parallelization approach
  - Resource requirements
  
Tasks:
  task-1:
    purpose: What this task does
    parallel: true/false
    dependencies: none/[task-list]
    
  task-2:
    purpose: What this task does
    parallel: true/false
    dependencies: none/[task-list]
    
Result Aggregation:
  - How results combine
  - Conflict resolution
  - Output format
```

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Standards

### Task Deployment

```javascript
// REQUIRED: Clear task instructions
const taskInstructions = `
## Objective
[Single clear goal]

## Context
[All necessary information]

## Steps
1. [Specific action]
2. [Specific action]

## Success Criteria
- [Measurable outcome]

## Output Format
\`\`\`yaml
status: success/failure
data: [structured result]
summary: [description]
\`\`\`
`;

// REQUIRED: Proper error handling
try {
  const result = await deployTask(taskInstructions);
  validateResult(result);
} catch (error) {
  handleError(error);
}
```

### Parallelization Requirements

```yaml
Default Mode: Parallel
Sequential Only When:
  - Explicit dependencies exist
  - Resource constraints apply
  - Business logic requires

Parallelization Levels:
  - Small tasks: 8-10 parallel
  - Medium tasks: 5-7 parallel  
  - Large tasks: 3-5 parallel
```

### Error Handling

```yaml
Required Strategies:
  - Retry logic with backoff
  - Partial result recovery
  - Graceful degradation
  - Clear error reporting

Error Categories:
  - Task failures
  - Timeout errors
  - Resource constraints
  - Invalid inputs
```

## ðŸ“Š Quality Standards

### Code Metrics
- **Command size**: â‰¤500 lines (including embedded patterns)
- **Task instruction clarity**: Self-contained and complete
- **Parallelization ratio**: â‰¥70% of tasks parallel
- **Error handling coverage**: 100% of failure modes

### Performance Standards
- **Startup time**: <2 seconds
- **Task deployment**: <1 second per task
- **Result aggregation**: <5 seconds
- **Total execution**: Documented estimate

### Documentation Standards
- **Purpose clarity**: Understandable in one read
- **Usage examples**: At least 3 real scenarios
- **Error scenarios**: All failure modes documented
- **Performance notes**: Expected timings included

## ðŸš« Anti-Patterns

### Command Anti-Patterns
- **God commands**: Doing too much in one command
- **Hidden dependencies**: Assuming external state
- **Sequential thinking**: Not leveraging parallelism
- **Poor error handling**: Letting failures cascade
- **No learning**: Not capturing patterns

### Task Anti-Patterns
- **Vague instructions**: Sub-agents can't infer
- **External dependencies**: Referencing other commands
- **Shared state**: Creating race conditions
- **No validation**: Trusting all outputs
- **Poor aggregation**: Losing information in merge

## âœ… Quality Checklist

Before submission:
- [ ] Command is fully self-contained
- [ ] All sections documented
- [ ] Task orchestration clear
- [ ] Error handling complete
- [ ] Performance documented
- [ ] Examples provided
- [ ] Patterns embedded
- [ ] Learning mechanism included

During review:
- [ ] Parallelization optimized
- [ ] Instructions clear
- [ ] Output standardized
- [ ] Errors handled gracefully
- [ ] Code within limits
- [ ] Anti-patterns avoided

## ðŸŽ¯ Excellence Indicators

A command demonstrates excellence when:
1. **Execution is 10x faster** than manual approach
2. **Parallelization exceeds 80%** of operations
3. **Error recovery is automatic** and transparent
4. **Learning improves performance** over time
5. **User experience is seamless** despite complexity

## ðŸ“ˆ Continuous Improvement

### Metrics to Track
- Execution time trends
- Success rates
- Error patterns
- User feedback
- Parallelization efficiency

### Evolution Path
1. **Basic**: Functional orchestration
2. **Optimized**: Efficient parallelization
3. **Intelligent**: Adaptive strategies
4. **Autonomous**: Self-improving

---

**Standard Commitment**: Every command we create will be a masterpiece of orchestrationâ€”simple to use, powerful in execution, and continuously improving.
