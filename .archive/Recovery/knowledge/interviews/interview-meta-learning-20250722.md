# Meta-Learning Interview - Capture-Learnings Re-invocation

**Learning Value**: 4/10 (exact threshold)  
**Session**: Meta-learning about capture-learnings re-invocation after complete session  
**Date**: 2025-07-22  
**Context**: Repeated /capture-learnings invocation after tools-migration completion

## Dynamic Questions - Re-invocation Behavior

### 1. Re-invocation Intent
What motivated you to execute `/capture-learnings` again after the system completed a comprehensive learning capture session? Was there something specific missing from the first capture?

### 2. Process Clarity
Was it clear when the first capture-learnings session had completely finished? Did completion indicators (all todos marked complete, commit made) effectively communicate process conclusion?

### 3. Additional Content Expectations
Did you expect the second invocation to generate different or additional content from the first session? What type of additional insights or patterns were you seeking?

### 4. System Understanding
How do you understand the capture-learnings system works? Should it behave differently when invoked repeatedly without substantial new content?

### 5. Meta-Learning Utility
Do you find this type of analysis about repeated command usage useful? Is there value in capturing user behavior patterns with the system?

### 6. Workflow Optimization
What would you improve in system communication to make clearer when a learning session is complete and when re-invoking the command is useful?
