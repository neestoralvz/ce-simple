# System Evolution Discovery

**Session**: Command re-invocation behavioral analysis  
**Learning Value**: 4/10 (threshold)  
**Focus**: User experience and completion signaling optimization  
**Date**: 2025-07-22

## Evolution Insights

### User Behavior Analysis
Users re-invoke learning commands when completion signals unclear. Evidence: Immediate `/capture-learnings` re-invocation after complete session. Implication: Need enhanced completion communication.

### Meta-Learning Recognition
Threshold-based capture (4/10) effectively identifies behavioral patterns. Evidence: User patterns provide UX insights. Implication: Framework successfully captures behavior data.

### Evolution Opportunities

#### Completion Signals
Current: Todo completion and git commits indicate completion. Opportunity: Enhanced visual/textual signals. Implementation: Add explicit completion messages.

#### Behavioral Analytics
Current: Limited re-invocation tracking. Opportunity: Systematic pattern analysis framework. Implementation: Usage tracking with pattern recognition.

#### Progressive Disclosure
Current: Fixed capture depth from threshold scoring. Opportunity: Adaptive depth from user preferences. Implementation: Preference tracking for intensity.
