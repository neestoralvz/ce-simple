# Agent Orchestration

## Purpose
Deploy and coordinate agents for intelligent workflow orchestration across commands.

## Usage
Referenced by `/start`, `/explore-codebase`, `/think-layers`, `/problem-solving`. Auto-triggered by complexity thresholds.

## Implementation

### Behavioral Reinforcement
Generate todos at module activation:

```
Analyze request complexity and determine optimal agent strategy
Evaluate context sufficiency for parallel vs sequential deployment
Execute intelligent agent coordination based on complexity matrix
Monitor agent capacity and optimize workload distribution
Track agent progress with real-time coordination updates
Synchronize agent results and prepare consolidated output
```

### Complexity Assessment
1. **Scope**: Analyze request depth, breadth, and interdependency requirements
2. **Scoring**: Apply complexity matrix (1-10 scale) with deployment decision tree  
3. **Strategy**: Determine optimal agent architecture based on scoring results
4. **Deployment**: Execute coordinated agent activation with monitoring protocols

### Agent Deployment

#### Sequential (Complexity 1-5)
For simple requests, linear workflows, dependency-heavy operations.

- **Simple** (1-3): Single agent with basic monitoring
- **Moderate** (4-5): 2-3 agents with dependency coordination
- **Requirement**: Previous results needed for next agent

#### Parallel (Complexity 6-10)
For independent research, multi-domain exploration, high-performance requirements.

- **Moderate** (6-7): 2-4 agents with basic synchronization  
- **High** (8-9): 4-8 agents with advanced coordination
- **Maximum** (10): 8-16 agents with intelligent load balancing

### Coordination Protocols

#### Load Management
- Monitor cognitive load and processing limits
- Redistribute workload based on agent performance
- Minimize cognitive loss during agent handoffs
- Handle agent failures with seamless continuation

#### Progress Tracking
Track agent deployment, progress percentage, synchronization, and completion status.

#### Result Consolidation
1. Gather all agent outputs with metadata tagging
2. Verify result completeness and quality standards
3. Consolidate findings into coherent narrative
4. Generate structured results with cross-references

### Integration

#### Command Interfaces
- `/start` - Auto-triggered during discovery workflow orchestration
- `/explore-codebase` - Triggered for internal discovery coordination  
- `/think-layers` - Progressive analysis scaling and cognitive load management
- `/problem-solving` - Enhanced Phase 0 structural assessment coordination

#### Dependencies
**Required**: behavioral-reinforcement, notification-system, validation-protocols
**Optional**: matrix-maintenance, performance-analytics
