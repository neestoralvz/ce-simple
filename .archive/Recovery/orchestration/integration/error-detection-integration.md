# Error Detection Integration

## Purpose
Automatic error detection and problem-solving workflow activation for all commands.

## Error Detection Protocol

### Error Classification
- **Critical**: System failures, command execution failures, corrupted states
- **High**: Functional failures, significant performance degradation, data issues  
- **Medium**: Partial failures, warning conditions, suboptimal performance
- **Low**: Minor issues, configuration warnings, cosmetic problems

### Auto-Trigger Conditions
**Command Failures**: Tool errors, exceptions, timeouts, resource access failures
**System Health**: Performance below threshold, memory exhaustion, integration failures, data integrity violations
**User Experience**: Unexpected behavior, mismatched results, workflow interruption, configuration failures

## Command Integration Points

### `/start` Integration
Monitor workflow execution, auto-trigger problem-solving on critical issues, preserve context for analysis.

### `/explore-codebase` Integration
Detect search failures, context errors, missing dependencies. Trigger systematic investigation.

### `/explore-web` Integration
Handle connection failures, research gaps, insufficient results. Activate alternative approaches.

### `/docs-workflow` Integration
Detect health score degradation, optimization failures. Trigger systematic resolution.

## Activation Logic

Calculate error severity, system impact, and user experience impact. Trigger problem-solving based on total score thresholds or user-reported issues.

## Context Preservation

Preserve originating command, execution context, error details (type, severity, message, system state), environment context (timestamp, system load, resource usage), and user context (workflow, expected outcome, previous actions).

## Notifications

### Error Detection
Notify error severity, initiate diagnosis, launch systematic investigation, activate expert analysis.

### Problem-Solving Integration
Activate from origin command, preserve context, enhance analysis, generate solution plan.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Core Commands**: Add error detection to `/start`, `/explore-codebase`, `/explore-web`
2. **Specialized Commands**: Enhance documentation workflows with systematic error handling
3. **System-Wide**: Global error detection with comprehensive logging and predictive analysis

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Requirements
- No false positives from legitimate command variations
- Accurate error context preservation
- Minimal performance impact on normal execution
- Graceful recovery capability

### Success Metrics  
- Detection accuracy >95%
- Resolution efficiency <30% time increase vs manual debugging
- Seamless user experience transition
- No system performance degradation
