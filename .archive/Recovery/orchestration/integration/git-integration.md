# Git Integration

## Purpose
Standardized Git integration patterns for workflow commands to enable automatic session-completion tracking, quality metrics, and collaboration features.

## Standard Commit Templates

### Success Completion Template
```
[command]: [action] completed

Results: Files processed [N], Execution time [X] minutes, Quality score [X]%, Status [Success/Partial/Issues]
Metrics: [Primary metric] [X]%, [Secondary metric] [X]%, [Tertiary metric] [X]%
Actions: [Action 1] [Result], [Action 2] [Result], [Action 3] [Result]

### Health Check Template
```
[command]: [type] health check completed

Health Check: [Date] system maintenance validation
Status: [Healthy/Attention-Needed/Critical]
Quality: [X]% (trend: [direction])
Actions: [none-required/maintenance-scheduled/immediate-attention]

```

### Discovery Workflow Template
```
[command]: [intent] | [complexity]([X]) | [X]min | [outcome]

```

### Partial Success Template
```
[command]: Partial [action] completion

Execution Status: [X]/[Y] operations completed successfully
Completed: [list of successful operations]
Issues: [list of issues encountered]
Recovery: [recommended recovery actions]

## Core Integration Patterns

### Session-Completion Commit Protocol
Git operations execute only on successful workflow completion with post-execution commit containing comprehensive metrics and structured messages.

### Standard Commit Message Structure
```
[command]: [operation] | [key-metric] | [X]min | [outcome]

## Metric Integration Functions

### Quality Score Tracking
Calculate quality scores and validate thresholds for workflow completion with automated assessment and configurable thresholds.

### File Change Analytics  
Count file changes, identify change types, perform statistical analysis of repository modifications.

### Workflow Intelligence Capture
Capture execution context, generate next-step recommendations, enable context-aware workflow progression and optimization.

## Workflow-Specific Integration

### Documentation Workflow Patterns
- docs-workflow: Pre-execution baseline capture, phase-by-phase progress tracking, quality improvement measurement, recursive iteration documentation
- docs-generate: 3-wave execution tracking, parallel agent performance metrics, cross-reference network analysis, template compliance measurement
- docs-audit: System health assessment capture, issue identification and categorization, baseline establishment, trend analysis preparation

### Error Recovery Integration
Handle partial completions and error recovery with structured commit messages for recovery tracking and continuation.

## Collaboration Features

### Multi-User Workflow Support
Context-aware collaboration with sync recommendations, repository synchronization analysis, and user coordination.

### Branch Strategy Integration
Risk-aware branching, automated merge readiness assessment, experimental branch management with quality-based merge criteria.

## Analytics and Intelligence

### Historical Analysis Functions
Calculate workflow trends, identify quality patterns over time using statistical analysis of workflow execution history.

### Predictive Intelligence
Suggest optimal execution time, recommend maintenance schedule using predictive analytics based on historical execution patterns.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Integration Requirements
- Success-only commits on workflow completion
- Structured messages for consistency and parseability
- Quantitative data for trend analysis
- Actionable insights and recommendations

### Error Handling
- Document completed phases and recovery plans for partial success
- Track error resolution patterns for system improvement
- Maintain rollback safety to previous stable state

### Collaboration Standards
- Multi-user support with context-aware commit messages
- Experimental branches for high-risk operations
- Monitor and recommend collaboration synchronization

This integration operates on session-completion principle, ensuring Git operations enhance rather than impede workflow execution while providing comprehensive tracking and collaboration capabilities.
