# TodoWrite Command Integration Patterns

## Purpose
Practical implementation patterns for automatic TodoWrite behavioral reinforcement across all commands for consistent validation, evaluation, and decision-making.

## Implementation Templates

### Pattern 1: Command Initialization Todo Generation
Generate behavioral reinforcement todos at command start:

```
Execute structural validation protocol
Assess context sufficiency for current task
Apply quality assurance checkpoints
Generate progress notifications for user
```

### Pattern 2: Dynamic Todo Adaptation Based on Context
Generate specific todos based on detected patterns:

**Complex Task Detected**:
```
Deploy parallel agents for efficiency
Monitor cognitive load across agents
```

**Simple Task Detected**:
```
Execute sequential workflow optimization
```

**Quality Issues Detected**:
```
URGENT: Apply correction protocol before proceeding
```

## Command-Specific Integration Examples

### `/start` Command Enhancement
Generate todos at command initialization:

```
Execute structural validation - verify docs/, context/, .claude/ directories
Analyze user request complexity for optimal workflow
Generate dynamic clarification questions
Determine parallel vs sequential agent deployment
Monitor workflow progress with transparent notifications
```

### `/explore-codebase` Command Enhancement  
Generate todos at exploration start:

```
Assess codebase size for optimal parallelization (12-52 operations)
Deploy parallel operations: Glob + Grep + Read based on assessment
Apply anti-bias discovery protocols - no assumptions
Validate structural patterns discovered during analysis
Generate context documentation from findings
```

### `/think-layers` Command Enhancement
Generate todos for progressive analysis:

```
Determine required thinking depth via complexity scoring
Execute L1 analysis: Surface patterns and basic understanding
Assess escalation need: contradictions or solution inadequacy
Apply plan consolidation with agent delegation
Trigger automatic learning capture if complexity â‰¥4
```

### `/docs-workflow` Command Enhancement
Generate todos for documentation quality:

```
Execute comprehensive system health assessment
Apply 85% minimum health score requirement
Implement recursive optimization if threshold not met
Generate Git tracking for documentation changes
Trigger automatic learning capture post-workflow
```

## Progressive Todo Management

### Real-Time Status Updates
1. **Start Todo**: Mark as in_progress when beginning action
2. **Complete Todo**: Mark as completed immediately after action completion  
3. **Add Discovered Todos**: Generate new todos based on discoveries during execution
4. **User Transparency**: All todo changes visible to user for progress tracking

### Dynamic Todo Addition
Add todos based on runtime discoveries:

**Structural Issues Discovered**:
```
URGENT: Fix structural violation - [specific issue]
```

**Performance Optimization Detected**:
```
Implement performance enhancement - [specific optimization]
```

**Learning Opportunity Identified**:
```
Capture learning pattern - [specific insight]
```

## Integration Checklist

### Command Integration Requirements
- Initialization: TodoWrite generation at command start  
- Context Adaptation: Dynamic todos based on detected patterns
- Progress Tracking: Real-time todo status updates
- Discovery Integration: New todos added based on findings
- User Transparency: All changes visible for progress monitoring

### Quality Assurance Standards
- Consistency: All commands use standardized todo patterns
- Behavioral Reinforcement: Critical validations never missed
- Progress Visibility: User always understands current status
- Cognitive Load: Optimal todo density (3-7 per command)

### Success Metrics
- 100% Command Coverage: All commands implement TodoWrite reinforcement
- Zero Missed Validations: Structural and quality checks automated
- Enhanced User Experience: Clear progress understanding
- Behavioral Consistency: Predictable workflow execution

## Implementation Steps

### High Priority
1. Update `/start` command with behavioral reinforcement todos
2. Enhance `/explore-codebase` with dynamic parallelization todos
3. Integrate `/think-layers` with progressive analysis todos
4. Apply `/docs-workflow` quality threshold todos

### Validation Protocol
1. Test Integration: Verify todo generation works correctly
2. User Feedback: Validate improved experience and transparency
3. Performance: Ensure no significant overhead from todo operations
4. Refinement: Optimize based on usage patterns and feedback
