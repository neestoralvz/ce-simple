# Universal Orchestrator Rules

## Core Principles
- Orchestrators coordinate, never execute directly
- Delegate to specialized agents  
- Maintain cognitive limits (max 4 targets)
- Apply mathematical verification

## Coordination Rules
- Deploy hierarchical dynamics
- Use strict protocol communication
- Self-contain references
- Send compact notifications

## Implementation Patterns
- Use Task() for component deployment
- Validate before execution
- Auto-handoff at 90% context
- Enable continuous system evolution
