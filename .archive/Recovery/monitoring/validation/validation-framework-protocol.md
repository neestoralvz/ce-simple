# Validation Framework Protocol

## Health Scoring Standards

### Universal Health Score Calculation
**Base Formula**: 100-point scale across 5 core dimensions
- **Structural Integrity**: 25 points (file organization, size compliance)
- **Content Quality**: 25 points (density, clarity, accuracy)
- **Reference Health**: 20 points (functional links, navigation efficiency)
- **Standards Compliance**: 15 points (format consistency, naming conventions)
- **Integration Quality**: 15 points (cross-command compatibility, workflow efficiency)

### Quality Thresholds
- **‚â•90 points**: Excellent - Optimal system health
- **75-89 points**: Good - Minor optimization opportunities
- **60-74 points**: Moderate - Attention required
- **<60 points**: Poor - Systematic remediation needed
- **<85 points**: Below threshold - Triggers automatic optimization

## Issue Classification Matrix

### Severity Levels
**CRITICAL** (Immediate action required):
- File size violations >200 lines
- Broken references >10% of total
- Content duplication >40% overlap
- Core functionality failures

**WARNING** (Review recommended):
- Files approaching size limits (180-200 lines)
- Broken references 5-10% of total
- Moderate duplication (20-40% overlap)
- Standards compliance gaps

**INFO** (Optimization opportunities):
- Files approaching optimization targets (140+ lines)
- Minor reference issues <5%
- Low-impact duplication <20%
- Performance improvement potential

## Validation Protocols

### Automated Validation Commands
```bash
# File size compliance check
find . -name "*.md" -exec wc -l {} \; | awk '$1 > [limit]' | sort -nr

# Reference integrity validation
grep -r "\.md" --include="*.md" . | grep -v "archive" | wc -l

# Content duplication detection
grep -r "[pattern]" --include="*.md" . | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

### Quality Gate Standards
**Pre-execution Gates**:
- [ ] File structure validated
- [ ] Reference network functional
- [ ] Size compliance verified
- [ ] Content standards met

**Post-execution Gates**:
- [ ] Health score ‚â•85%
- [ ] Critical issues resolved
- [ ] Warning issues addressed
- [ ] Integration compatibility confirmed

## Error Handling Framework

### Failure Detection Patterns
```
‚ö†Ô∏è THRESHOLD: Health score [X]% below 85% minimum
üîç ANALYSIS: [N] critical, [N] warning, [N] info issues detected
üìä METRICS: [Failed dimension]: [Score]/[Max] ([Gap] points below standard)
üéØ FOCUS: [Primary area] requires immediate attention
```

### Recovery Protocols
```
üîÑ CORRECTION: Deploying targeted optimization ‚Üí Focus: [specific issues]
‚ö° RETRY: [Correction type] applied ‚Üí Re-validation triggered
üìà PROGRESS: [Previous]% ‚Üí [Current]% ([+/-X] point change)
‚úÖ SUCCESS: Threshold achieved ‚Üí System health restored
```

### Recursive Optimization Logic
1. **Validate**: Execute comprehensive health assessment
2. **Evaluate**: Compare score against 85% threshold
3. **Decide**: SUCCESS (‚â•85%) ‚Üí Complete | RETRY (<85% + attempts<3) ‚Üí Optimize | ESCALATE (attempts‚â•3) ‚Üí Manual
4. **Execute**: Apply targeted corrections with error context
5. **Re-validate**: Measure improvement and iterate

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Targets
