# Hierarchical Cognitive Architecture

## Overview

Dynamic hierarchical architecture with unlimited orchestrator depth and strict cognitive compliance.

## Core Principles

- Maximum 4 targets per orchestrator
- Unlimited depth via recursive deployment
- Dynamic creation with mathematical validation
- Adaptive scaling

## Hierarchical Structure

**[L0]: Master Coordinator**
- User interface and analysis
- Mission deployment and progress coordination
- Quality assurance

**[L1+]: Dynamic Orchestrator Hierarchy**
- Core Domain Orchestrators (4 standard)
- Dynamic Specialized Orchestrators (created as needed)
- Sub-orchestrator deployment for complex workflows
- Recursive hierarchy for ultra-complex tasks

**[LN]: Protocol-Optimized Agents**
- 6 Core Protocol-Specialized Agents
- Dynamic agents for novel requirements
- Universal tool access with protocol optimization
- Direct Claude Code tool execution

## Cognitive Load Management

**4-Target Limit Enforcement**:
- Maximum 4 targets per orchestrator
- Automatic sub-orchestrator creation
- Mathematical compliance validation

**Dynamic Scaling**:
- Simple tasks: Single orchestrator
- Complex workflows: Multi-level hierarchy
- Ultra-complex: Recursive orchestrator generation
- Real-time depth adjustment

## Orchestrator Types

**Core Domain Orchestrators**:
- Content (documentation + quality)
- Technical (system + commands)
- Intelligence (exploration + analysis)
- Integration (handoffs + system)

**Dynamic Specialized Orchestrators**:
- Domain-specific (ML, blockchain)
- Workflow-specific (migration, API integration)
- Performance-optimized (high-demand)
- Temporary (one-time complex workflows)

## Communication Protocol

**Hierarchical Communication**:
Zero receives requests → Mission deployment → Progress reporting → Result consolidation

**Context Management**:
- Optimization at each level
- 90% handoff triggers
- Compression transfer
- Mathematical tracking

## Implementation Framework

**Orchestrator Creation**:
Analyze complexity → Determine specialization → Generate via templates → Validate compliance

**Hierarchy Management**:
Monitor cognitive load → Create sub-orchestrators → Optimize paths → Maintain coherence

**Agent Deployment**:
Deploy at levels → Universal tool access → Protocol specialization → Seamless integration
