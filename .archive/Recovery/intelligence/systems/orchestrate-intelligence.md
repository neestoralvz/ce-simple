3. Switch to sequential processing if parallel fails
4. Manual intervention if automated fails

**Context Preservation Failure**:
1. Reconstruct context from available sources
2. Re-brief specialists with available context
3. Build context iteratively through interaction
4. Increase validation to compensate for loss

**Synthesis Failure Recovery**:
