# Pragmatic Foundation - Fundamental Principle

## ðŸŽ¯ GOLDEN PRINCIPLE

**"Practical effectiveness over theoretical perfection"**

### Pragmatic Manifesto

**SIMPLICITY FIRST**: If something cannot be explained in 3 lines, it is too complex.

**IMMEDIATE EXECUTABILITY**: Every solution MUST be implementable in less than 30 minutes or divided until achieved.

**LEAN FUNCTIONALITY**: Make it work BEFORE making it elegant. Refinement after, never before.

**MINIMUM VIABLE STRUCTURE**: The least amount of files, folders and abstractions necessary to achieve the objective.

**PRAGMATISM OVER DOGMA**: If a rule prevents progress, question it. If a practice does not provide immediate value, eliminate it.

## ðŸš€ OPERATIONAL DECISION FILTERS

**Is it needed NOW?** â†’ If not, do not do it  
**Does it work with minimum?** â†’ If not, simplify  
**Can it be tested easily?** â†’ If not, redesign  
**Does it provide immediate value?** â†’ If not, eliminate

## ðŸ“‹ OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLES

1. **Constant MVP**: Each functionality MUST have a minimum functional version in maximum 15 minutes
2. **Rapid Iteration**: Prefer 10 small improvements over 1 large improvement  
3. **Immediate Feedback**: If it cannot be tested in <5 minutes, redesign
4. **Controlled Complexity**: Maximum 3 levels of depth in any structure
5. **Intelligent Reuse**: Copy and adapt is better than premature abstraction

## ðŸŽ­ IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY

### Pragmatic Development
- **One functionality per week** that works 100%
- **Maximum 50 lines documentation** per component
- **Immediate test**: If it does not work in 5 minutes â†’ total redesign
- **Single function**: One component, one clear purpose

### Success Criteria
- **Works**: Can be executed without errors
- **Testable**: Can be verified in less than 5 minutes  
- **Useful**: Provides immediate and measurable value
- **Simple**: Explained in 3 lines or less
