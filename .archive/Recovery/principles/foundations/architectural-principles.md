# Architectural Principles

## Purpose
Core architectural principles for ce-simple command system design and operation.

## Core Philosophy
- **Pragmatic Effectiveness**: Practical results over theoretical perfection
- **Autocontained Commands**: Complete functionality within command network
- **LLM Optimized**: Documentation designed for Claude Code consumption
- **Anti-Bias Processing**: Evidence-based discovery without assumptions

## System Components
- **Commands**: Workflow coordination and agent orchestration
- **Standards**: Implementation frameworks and guidelines
- **Context**: Learning patterns and architectural decisions

## Simplicity Framework
- **Direct Communication**: Clear instructions without verbose explanations
- **Execution Focus**: Commands execute workflows, not educational content
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex details in referenced files
- **Function Priority**: Execution value over explanation value

## Implementation Standards
Commands in `.claude/commands/` follow:
- LLM-optimized writing structure
- Real-time workflow notifications
- Anti-bias protocols
- Standardized command structure
- Date-based maintenance with temporal context

## Quality Framework
- **Progressive Validation**: Multi-layer verification
- **Cross-Command Integration**: Seamless workflow continuity
- **Success Metrics**: Quantifiable completion indicators
- **Error Recovery**: Robust fallback mechanisms
