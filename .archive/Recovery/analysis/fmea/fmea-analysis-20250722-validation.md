### 5. Dependency Loop Formation (Low Priority)
**Description**: Circular dependencies between commands or documentation
- **Severity**: 4/5 - Can cause system deadlocks
- **Occurrence**: 1/5 - Very rare with current architecture
- **Detection**: 3/5 - Requires specialized analysis
- **RPN**: 12 (Low Risk, Monitor)
- **Impact**: System deadlocks, unpredictable behavior
- **Current State**: No circular dependencies detected in current analysis

### 6. Matrix Validation Failures (Low Priority)
**Description**: Matrix maintenance system itself failing
- **Severity**: 5/5 - System loses self-monitoring capability
- **Occurrence**: 1/5 - Robust implementation reduces risk
- **Detection**: 2/5 - Self-validation challenges
- **RPN**: 10 (Low Risk)
- **Impact**: Loss of system health monitoring, gradual degradation
- **Current State**: Matrix validation functioning correctly (97.8% health)
