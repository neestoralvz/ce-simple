# Parallel-Operations Behavior

## ðŸŽ¯ PRINCIPLE: Parallel Execution Required
**Applied by**: Components when dependencies allow parallel processing
**Purpose**: Maximize efficiency through parallel operations
**Scope**: All operations that can be parallelized

## âš¡ RULES

### Core Rules
- Analyze dependencies before execution
- Execute independent operations in parallel
- Coordinate parallel results efficiently

### Implementation Pattern
```
WHEN: Multiple independent operations
DO: Identify parallel opportunities and execute simultaneously
VERIFY: Parallel efficiency and result coordination
```

### Verification Protocol
Mathematical verification of parallel execution efficiency gains

### Success Indicators
- Parallel opportunities identified correctly
- Execution efficiency maximized
