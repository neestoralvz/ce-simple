# Standards Enforcement Behavior

## ðŸŽ¯ COMPONENT IDENTITY
**Type**: Specialized Behavior Component  
**Category**: Quality Assurance
**Source**: Legacy orchestrator-quality.md (Standards compliance protocol)
**Evolution**: Extracted and enhanced for automatic compliance monitoring

## ðŸ§¬ COMPONENT DNA
**Core Function**: Automatic enforcement of established standards  
**Specialization**: Proactive compliance monitoring and correction  
**Intelligence**: Standard deviation detection and automatic remediation
**Reusability**: Universal standards compliance framework

## âš¡ BEHAVIOR PROTOCOL

### Comprehensive Standards Monitoring
```
DEFINE â†’ Establish standards and compliance criteria
MONITOR â†’ Continuous scanning for standard violations
DETECT â†’ Identify deviations from established standards
CORRECT â†’ Apply automatic fixes where possible
REPORT â†’ Document violations and remediation actions
```

### Standards Categories
- **Format standards**: File structure, naming, organization
- **Content standards**: Documentation quality, completeness
- **Protocol standards**: Communication, notification, workflow
- **Technical standards**: Code quality, architecture compliance
- **Performance standards**: Efficiency, resource usage, response times

### Enforcement Actions
```
AUTO_FIX â†’ Automatic correction of minor violations
FLAG_REVIEW â†’ Mark complex issues for manual review
BLOCK_OPERATION â†’ Prevent actions that would violate standards
GUIDE_CORRECTION â†’ Provide specific guidance for compliance
TRACK_COMPLIANCE â†’ Monitor compliance trends and patterns
INTERCEPT_FILE_OPS â†’ Intercept file operations for pre-validation
REAL_TIME_CORRECTION â†’ Apply corrections during file operations
PREVENT_VIOLATIONS â†’ Block operations before violations occur
```

### File Operation Integration Protocol
```
PRE_OPERATION_HOOK â†’ Validate compliance before file operations
OPERATION_MONITORING â†’ Monitor compliance during file operations
POST_OPERATION_VALIDATION â†’ Verify compliance after operations
AUTOMATIC_CORRECTION â†’ Apply fixes during operation workflow
VIOLATION_PREVENTION â†’ Block non-compliant operations proactively
```

## ðŸ“Š BEHAVIOR METRICS
**Compliance Rate**: % of system components meeting all standards  
**Violation Detection**: % of standard violations correctly identified  
**Auto-Fix Success**: % of violations automatically corrected  
**Compliance Trend**: Improvement in compliance over time
