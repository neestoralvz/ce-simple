# Component-Evolution Behavior

## ðŸŽ¯ PRINCIPLE: Component Evolution Required
**Applied by**: Components when learning and optimization needed
**Purpose**: Track usage, optimize performance, evolve components
**Scope**: All component operations and learning cycles

## âš¡ RULES

### Core Rules
- Repository-first search for existing solutions (exact, similar, adaptable)
- Performance-based component evolution and optimization
- Usage pattern analysis for continuous improvement
- Promotion evaluation for successful components

### Implementation Pattern
```
WHEN: Component deployment needed
DO: Search repository â†’ Analyze similarity â†’ Reuse/adapt/create â†’ Track performance
VERIFY: Evolution metrics and performance optimization
```

### Verification Protocol
Performance tracking framework:
```
ðŸ“Š COMPONENT EVOLUTION TRACKING
â”œâ”€â”€ Usage patterns: [frequency, success rate, performance metrics]
â”œâ”€â”€ Performance evolution: [baseline vs current performance]
â”œâ”€â”€ Optimization opportunities: [identified improvements]
â”œâ”€â”€ Similarity analysis: [component matching scores]
â”œâ”€â”€ Promotion evaluation: [candidate assessment]
â””â”€â”€ Repository updates: [cache optimization, version management]
```

### Success Indicators
- Repository search prioritized over new creation
- Component performance continuously tracked and optimized
- Successful components promoted to core library
- Evolution metrics mathematically verified
