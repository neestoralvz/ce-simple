**Reusability**: Universal error management framework

## âš¡ BEHAVIOR PROTOCOL

### Error Management Operations
```
CONTINUOUS_MONITORING â†’ Real-time error detection across system operations
PATTERN_RECOGNITION â†’ Identify error patterns and recurring issues
AUTOMATIC_CORRECTION â†’ Apply intelligent fixes for common error types
ESCALATION_MANAGEMENT â†’ Handle complex errors requiring human intervention
PREVENTION_LEARNING â†’ Learn from errors to prevent future occurrences
```

### Error Detection Dimensions
- **Syntax errors**: Code and configuration syntax issues
- **Logic errors**: Workflow and process logic problems
- **Integration errors**: Component communication and compatibility issues
- **Performance errors**: Efficiency and resource utilization problems
- **Data errors**: Information consistency and integrity problems

### Correction Strategies
```
IMMEDIATE_FIX â†’ Automatic correction for known error patterns
GUIDED_RESOLUTION â†’ Provide specific correction guidance
ROLLBACK_RECOVERY â†’ Restore system to stable state when needed
ESCALATED_REPAIR â†’ Route complex errors to appropriate specialists
PREVENTIVE_ADJUSTMENT â†’ Modify system to prevent error recurrence
```

## ðŸ“Š BEHAVIOR METRICS
**Detection Accuracy**: % of actual errors correctly identified  
**Correction Success Rate**: % of errors successfully fixed automatically  
**Prevention Effectiveness**: % reduction in recurring error types  
**Resolution Time**: Average time from detection to correction

## ðŸŽ¯ REUSE SCENARIOS
- Quality assurance systems requiring proactive error management
- Complex systems prone to various error types
- Production environments requiring high reliability
- Evolving systems where new error patterns emerge
