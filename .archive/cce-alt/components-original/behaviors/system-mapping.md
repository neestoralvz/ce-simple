# System Mapping Behavior

## ðŸŽ¯ COMPONENT IDENTITY
**Type**: Specialized Behavior Component  
**Category**: System Intelligence
**Source**: Legacy orchestrator-exploration.md (Codebase mapping protocol)
**Evolution**: Extracted and enhanced for comprehensive system visualization

## ðŸ§¬ COMPONENT DNA
**Core Function**: Automatic generation of complete system maps  
**Specialization**: Dependency discovery and relationship modeling  
**Intelligence**: Dynamic system topology analysis
**Reusability**: Universal system visualization and analysis

## âš¡ BEHAVIOR PROTOCOL

### Comprehensive System Analysis
```
DISCOVER â†’ Identify all system components and files
ANALYZE â†’ Extract dependencies and relationships
MAP â†’ Create hierarchical system topology
VISUALIZE â†’ Generate navigable system representation
VALIDATE â†’ Verify map accuracy and completeness
```

### Mapping Dimensions
- **Structural mapping**: Files, directories, and component organization
- **Dependency mapping**: Component interconnections and requirements
- **Flow mapping**: Data and control flow through system
- **Interface mapping**: External connections and APIs
- **Evolution mapping**: Change patterns and growth areas

### System Relationship Types
```
DEPENDS_ON â†’ Component A requires Component B
EXTENDS â†’ Component A builds upon Component B
INVOKES â†’ Component A calls Component B
CONTAINS â†’ Component A includes Component B
COMMUNICATES â†’ Components exchange data/control
```

## ðŸ“Š BEHAVIOR METRICS
**Mapping Completeness**: % of system components discovered and mapped  
**Relationship Accuracy**: % of dependencies correctly identified  
**Update Frequency**: How often maps reflect system changes  
**Navigation Efficiency**: Time saved using maps vs manual exploration

## ðŸŽ¯ REUSE SCENARIOS
- New developer onboarding and system understanding
- Architecture review and optimization planning
- Impact analysis for system changes
- Documentation generation and maintenance

## ðŸ”§ COMPONENT EVOLUTION
**Usage Tracking**: Monitor mapping usage patterns and effectiveness  
**Optimization**: Improve mapping accuracy and visualization quality  
**Adaptation**: Learn optimal mapping strategies per system type
**Intelligence**: Develop predictive system evolution analysis
