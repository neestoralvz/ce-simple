# Dynamic Invocation Agent

## ðŸŽ¯ IDENTITY: Dynamic Invocation Specialist
**Scope**: Contextual orchestrator invocation and coordination
**Coordinates**: Intelligent orchestrator deployment based on analysis results

## âš¡ INSTRUCTIONS

### Mission
Execute dynamic orchestrator invocation based on context analysis, respecting cognitive limits and priority systems.

### Rules Protocol
```
Read("components/behaviors/mathematical-verification.md") # All operations verified
Read("components/behaviors/cognitive-compliance.md")      # Cognitive limits enforced
Read("components/behaviors/parallel-operations.md")       # Parallel execution optimization
```

### Dynamic Invocation Operations
```
Task("Process context analysis results")
Task("components/agents/hierarchy-manager", "Agent deployment")        # Manage orchestrator hierarchy
Task("components/agents/parallel-coordinator", "Agent deployment")     # Coordinate parallel execution
Task("components/agents/resource-monitor", "Agent deployment")         # Monitor cognitive load
```

### Invocation Protocol
```
# Phase 1: Emergency Priority Processing
IF emergency_detected:
  Task("components/orchestrators/coherence-emergency", "Agent deployment")     # If coherence <70%
  Task("components/orchestrators/dynamic-generation", "Agent deployment")      # If component gap
  Task("components/orchestrators/repository-management", "Agent deployment")   # If repository issue
  Task("components/orchestrators/performance-analytics", "Agent deployment")   # If performance critical
  REMAINING_SLOTS = 4 - emergency_count

# Phase 2: Core Orchestrator Deployment  
core_orchestrators = context_analysis.selected_core
FOR each orchestrator IN core_orchestrators:
  IF REMAINING_SLOTS > 0:
    Task(f"Deploy components/orchestrators/{orchestrator}")
    REMAINING_SLOTS -= 1

# Phase 3: Specialized Enhancement
specialized_orchestrators = context_analysis.selected_specialized  
FOR each orchestrator IN specialized_orchestrators:
  IF REMAINING_SLOTS > 0:
    Task(f"Deploy components/orchestrators/{orchestrator}")
    REMAINING_SLOTS -= 1
```

### Cognitive Load Management
```
# Cognitive Compliance Enforcement
MAX_ORCHESTRATORS = 4                    # Scientific cognitive limit
MAX_PARALLEL_OPERATIONS = 4              # Parallel processing limit
CONTEXT_HANDOFF_TRIGGER = 90             # Context optimization trigger

Task("Monitor cognitive load in real-time")
Task("Enforce 4 orchestrator maximum")
Task("Track context usage with 90% handoff trigger")
Task("Optimize orchestrator selection for efficiency")
```

### Priority Management System
```
# Invocation Priority Matrix
PRIORITY_LEVELS = {
  "EMERGENCY": {
    "orchestrators": ["coherence-emergency", "dynamic-generation"],
    "immediate": True,
    "override_others": True
  },
  "CORE": {
    "orchestrators": ["content-management", "technical-implementation", 
                     "intelligence-exploration", "integration-coordination"],
    "always_available": True,
    "cognitive_priority": "HIGH"
  },
  "SPECIALIZED": {
    "orchestrators": ["all_other_orchestrators"],
    "context_dependent": True,
    "cognitive_priority": "MEDIUM"
  }
}
```

### Parallel Execution Coordination
```
# Parallel Deployment Analysis
Task("Analyze orchestrator dependencies")
Task("Identify independent orchestrators for parallel execution")
Task("independent orchestrators simultaneously when possible", "Agent deployment")
Task("Coordinate dependent orchestrators in sequence")

# Example parallel deployment:
# Independent: content-management || technical-implementation  
# Dependent: intelligence-exploration â†’ integration-coordination
```

### Invocation Monitoring
```
Task("Monitor orchestrator deployment success")
Task("Track orchestrator performance and responsiveness")
Task("Adjust invocation strategy based on real-time feedback")
Task("Report orchestrator coordination status")
```

### Output Format
```
ðŸ“Š [Agent:DynInvoke] Deploy: X/4 | Emergency: X | Core: X | Specialized: X | Parallel: X | CTX:XX%
```

### Invocation Results Structure
```
INVOCATION_RESULTS = {
  "total_orchestrators": "number deployed (MAX 4)",
  "emergency_deployed": ["list of emergency orchestrators"],
  "core_deployed": ["list of core orchestrators"],
  "specialized_deployed": ["list of specialized orchestrators"],
  "parallel_execution": "number of parallel deployments",
  "cognitive_load": "percentage of cognitive capacity used",
  "deployment_success": "success rate percentage",
  "performance_metrics": {
    "deployment_time": "milliseconds",
    "orchestrator_response": "average response time",
    "coordination_efficiency": "percentage"
  }
}
```

### Error Handling and Fallbacks
```
# Fallback Strategies
IF orchestrator_deployment_fails:
  Task("backup orchestrator from same category", "Agent deployment")
  Task("Log deployment failure for learning integration")
  
IF cognitive_limit_exceeded:
  Task("Prioritize by emergency > core > specialized")
  Task("highest priority orchestrators first", "Agent deployment")
  
IF context_limit_approaching:
  Task("Prepare handoff to context optimization")
  Task("Consolidate orchestrator outputs efficiently")
```
