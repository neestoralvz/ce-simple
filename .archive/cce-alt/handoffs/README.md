# Handoffs Directory

## 🎯 Purpose
Management of implementation handoffs between Claude Code sessions.

## 📁 Structure
- **Active handoffs**: Implementation tasks ready for execution
- **.archive/**: Completed handoffs (see `.archive/README.md`)

## 🔄 Handoff Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: New handoff with clear requirements
2. **Analysis**: Dependency mapping and execution planning  
3. **Execution**: Implementation with mathematical verification
4. **Completion**: Success criteria validated
5. **Archival**: Move to `.archive/` with results documented

## 📊 Current Status (Updated: 2025-07-21 - Post Consolidation)

### Implementation Status Overview
- **Total handoffs**: 7 (after consolidation cleanup)
- **Pending user approval**: 4 handoffs ⏸️ (command system)
- **Ready for execution**: 3 handoffs ✅ (protocol enforcement)
- **In progress**: 0 handoffs
- **Completed**: 0 handoffs (none implemented yet)

### Priority Categories
1. **Command System** (requires approval): handoff-commands.md, handoff-01-system-implementation.md, handoff-02-context-optimization.md, handoff-03-slash-commands.md
2. **System Foundation** (ready): handoff-universal-protocol-enforcement.md, handoff-priority-hierarchy-enforcement.md

### Key Findings
- **Zero handoffs fully implemented** - all represent designed but unexecuted enhancements
- **System in design-complete, implementation-pending state**
- **Command system cluster** requires user approval before any implementation
- **Protocol enforcement** should be implemented first as foundation
