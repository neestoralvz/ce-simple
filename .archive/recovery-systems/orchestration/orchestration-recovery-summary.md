## Key Systems Recovered

**Agent Orchestration Framework** - Sequential and parallel deployment strategies with dynamic complexity assessment and multi-agent coordination. Achieved 98.8% integrity scores.

**TodoWrite Integration System** - Automatic todo generation with behavioral reinforcement, validation protocols, and cross-command consistency patterns.

**Error Detection & Monitoring** - Comprehensive error handling with real-time progress tracking, performance metrics, and git workflow coordination.

**Execution Session Logs** - Complete operational documentation from 2025-07-22 with performance metrics, complexity scores, and pattern analysis insights.

## Recovery Verification

**Status**: Complete | **Files**: 14/14 | **Integrity**: 100%

All orchestration files successfully extracted from git history and organized by function in `/Users/nalve/ce-simple/Recovery/orchestration/`.

**Core Systems**: Agent orchestration framework, TodoWrite integration, error detection, and execution logs fully recovered with operational history preserved.
