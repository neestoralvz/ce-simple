# Agent Orchestration Implementation

## Purpose
Implementation specification for intelligent agent coordination with Phase 0 structural assessment protocols and failure prevention mechanisms.

## Phase 0 Context Integration

### Orchestration Decision Matrix
Context-driven agent deployment strategy based on structural completeness, dependency mapping, risk level, and validation gates passed.

### Agent Selection Framework
- **Internal Discovery**: explore-codebase (required, high priority, 52 operations)
- **External Research**: explore-web (optional, medium priority, 4-16 searches)  
- **Analysis Coordination**: think-layers (optional, low priority, 1-4 depth levels)

## Implementation Tool Calls

### Orchestration Assessment
Execute Phase 0 context assessment to calculate complexity and risk levels, then determine optimal deployment strategy.

### Intelligent Deployment Coordination

#### Sequential Deployment (1-5 complexity)
Execute agents in order with dependency handling and linear progression. Halt and assess on failure.

#### Parallel Deployment (6-10 complexity)  
Execute concurrent agents with synchronization points at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% completion.

### Validation-Guided Agent Parameters
Deploy agents with enhanced parameters based on Phase 0 validation results and 85% threshold enforcement.

## Coordination Protocols

### Real-Time Synchronization Framework
Track progress through validation checkpoints with gate conditions and proceed thresholds.

### Agent Communication Integration
Share context updates, validation checkpoints, and failure notifications across agent network.

## Failure Prevention Integration

### Agent-Level Risk Mitigation
- **Insufficient Context**: Deploy additional discovery agents if Phase 0 completeness < 85%
- **Dependency Failures**: Enhanced dependency analysis if coverage < 95%
- **Coordination Failures**: Failover to sequential execution on timeout

### Dynamic Orchestration Adjustment
Adjust orchestration in real-time based on Phase 0 findings and risk assessment.

## Behavioral Reinforcement Protocol

Generate enhanced TodoWrite integration at orchestration start:

```
Assess Phase 0 context for intelligent agent deployment
Calculate deployment strategy based on risk and complexity matrix
Execute validated agent coordination with synchronization points
Distribute cognitive load across agent network optimally
Coordinate agent results and maintain validation checkpoint progress
Integrate agent outputs with quality validation
```

## Performance Optimization

### Cognitive Load Management
- **Max Concurrent Agents**: 8
- **Context Switching Cost**: 0.1 performance penalty per agent switch
- **Memory Utilization Limit**: 80% maximum usage threshold

### Success Metrics
- **Deployment Time**: < 30 seconds
- **Synchronization Overhead**: < 15%
- **Agent Completion Rate**: > 95%
- **Phase 0 Integration**: > 90%

## Module Integration

### Command Dependencies
- start-impl.md - Phase 0 context provision and validation gate status
- problem-solving-implementation.md - Enhanced 6-phase methodology coordination
- structural-failure-prevention.md - Risk assessment and mitigation framework

### Execution Chain
Phase-0-Complete → Orchestration-Assessment → Strategy-Determination → Agent-Deployment → Synchronization-Management → Result-Consolidation

## Tool Call Requirements

Execute mandatory orchestration assessment, conditional agent deployment based on strategy, and synchronization management with result consolidation.
