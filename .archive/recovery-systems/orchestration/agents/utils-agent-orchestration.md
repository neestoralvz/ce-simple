# Agent Orchestration Utils

## Purpose
Utility functions and helper modules for agent orchestration support systems.

## Core Utilities

### Complexity Calculator
Calculate deployment strategy based on request scope, breadth, and interdependencies using 1-10 scale scoring.

### Load Balancer
Monitor cognitive capacity and distribute workload across agents optimally with failure recovery protocols.

### Progress Tracker
Real-time monitoring of agent deployment, execution progress, synchronization points, and completion status.

### Result Consolidator
Gather agent outputs, validate completeness, synthesize findings, and generate structured results with cross-references.

## Helper Functions

### Context Analyzer
Evaluate context sufficiency for parallel vs sequential deployment based on dependency requirements.

### Performance Monitor
Track execution metrics, quality scores, efficiency gains, and coordination effectiveness.

### Error Handler
Detect agent failures, implement recovery protocols, and maintain orchestration continuity.

### Notification Generator
Create progress updates, status notifications, and completion reports for user transparency.

## Integration Support

### Command Interface Helpers
Provide standardized interfaces for `/start`, `/explore-codebase`, `/think-layers`, and `/problem-solving` integration.

### Module Dependency Manager
Handle required modules (behavioral-reinforcement, notification-system, validation-protocols) and optional modules (matrix-maintenance, performance-analytics).

### Validation Gateway
Enforce quality thresholds, structural integrity checks, and cross-reference validation during orchestration.

These utilities support the main agent orchestration system with reusable functions for complexity assessment, load management, progress tracking, and result consolidation across all command integrations.
