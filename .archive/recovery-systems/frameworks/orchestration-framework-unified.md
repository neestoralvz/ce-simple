2. **Security Specialist**: Security implementation, compliance, threat assessment  
3. **Data Specialist**: Data architecture, storage solutions, processing pipelines
4. **Performance Specialist**: Performance optimization, scalability strategies
5. **Integration Specialist**: System integration, API design, connection strategies

### Deployment Decision Matrix
```yaml
Complexity Assessment:
  High (≥0.9): Advanced orchestration with 5+ specialists
  Standard (0.6-0.8): Multi-agent coordination with 3-4 specialists
  Simple (<0.6): Direct deployment with 1-2 specialists

Coordination Strategies:
  Sequential: Linear handoff for dependent tasks
  Parallel: Concurrent execution for independent domains
  Iterative: Refinement cycles for complex problems
