# Think Process Validation Framework

## Purpose
Validation protocols and success metrics for strategic intelligence engine handling requests through analysis, exploration, and execution.

## Architecture
Adaptive meta-orchestrator with modular composition:
- Request analysis intelligence
- Comprehensive exploration (`/scan-code`, `/scan-arch`, `/find-patterns`)
- Git strategy intelligence (`/git-strategy-optimize`, `/git-workflow`)
- Progressive strategic thinking
- Dynamic execution orchestration
- Adaptive verification
- Decision validation (`/meta/decision-engine`)
- Knowledge capture and learning

## Usage Relationships

### Entry Points
- Primary entry for any strategic request
- Complex orchestrator for comprehensive analysis
- Specialized workflows requiring intelligence

### Ecosystem Position

## Workflow Connections

### Completion Levels
- **Complete (9-10)**: Task done, knowledge captured, verification passed
- **Partial (7-8)**: Next phase ready, commands identified
- **Analysis (5-6)**: Manual intervention, recommendations provided

### Entry Patterns
- Any request: `/think-master "request"` → Intelligent execution
- Complex coordination: Multi-faceted orchestration
- Learning improvement: Pattern capture and enhancement

### Dynamic Routing
- Debugging: → `/run-debug`, `/scan-code`, `/find-solutions`
- Features: → `/git-strategy-optimize`, `/build-plan`, `/build-features`
- **Strategic optimization requests** → Automatic routing to `/scan-perf`, `/run-perf`, `/loop-feedback`, `/git-workflow` (strategic optimization branch strategy)
- **Strategic requests** → Automatic routing to `/research-plan`, `/git-strategy-optimize`, `/task-orchestrate`, `/coordinate-teams`

  **Convergence Criteria**:
  - Strategic request properly analyzed and classified
  - Appropriate strategic exploration completed for request type

  - Strategic knowledge captured for ecosystem improvement
  - **Escalation**: Human intervention with specific strategic recommendations after 3 failed strategic execution attempts

### Verification Loop (MANDATORY)

1. **Execute**: Orchestrate adaptive strategic request analysis → strategic exploration → strategic thinking → strategic execution → strategic verification
2. **Measure**: Track strategic request classification accuracy, strategic exploration completeness, strategic execution effectiveness, strategic verification success
3. **Evaluate**: Assess overall strategic user value delivery and strategic knowledge capture effectiveness
4. **Decision**: Continue if strategic metrics met, restart with refined strategic approach if <threshold, escalate with strategic recommendations after 3 attempts  
5. **Converge**: Stop when strategic request fully addressed OR clear strategic recommendations provided for manual action
