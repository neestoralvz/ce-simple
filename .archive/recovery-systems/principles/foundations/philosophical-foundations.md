## Core Principles

### 1. Meta-Principle
Stop trying to control the model. Enable it.

Provide comprehensive context and clear objectives, then allow autonomous execution without interference. Focus on enablement rather than control mechanisms.

### 2. Intelligence as Natural Phenomenon
Intelligence emerges through evolution, not design.

Use variation, selection, replication, and evolution cycles. Test multiple approaches, implement successful patterns, replicate proven methods, and evolve capabilities naturally.

### 3. Context > Commands > Prompts
Rich context enables autonomous excellence. Provide comprehensive context rather than precise rules.

Load complete project context, provide domain-specific knowledge, establish pattern understanding, and enable autonomous decision-making within defined boundaries.

### 4. Enable, Don't Control
Provide context and objectives, then allow autonomous execution.

Offer comprehensive context, define measurable objectives, establish verification protocols, enable autonomous iteration, and monitor performance non-invasively.

### 6. Natural Language Commands
Commands should be in natural language, simple and effective, clear and concise, easy to understand for humans.

Use human-readable format with simple, clear language. Avoid programming complexity, JavaScript, or technical abstractions. Provide direct, step-by-step guidance compatible with Claude Code.

Principles:
- Simplicity over complexity
- Natural over technical language
- Clear over clever
- Actionable over abstract

### 55. Tool Call Execution Bridging
LLMs execute real work via tool calls, not simulation. Use Task agents for execution guarantee.

Execute concrete actions using tool calls instead of simulating, describing, or documenting theoretical work. Transform conversational assistants into real execution agents.

Execution methods:
1. Simple tool calls: Direct execution for single actions
2. Complex workflows: Task agent deployment for multi-step processes  
3. Claude Code commands: Task agent deployment with announcements
4. Error scenarios: Automatic Task agent fallback

Deploy Task agents for complex command execution, capture real tool outputs, demonstrate functionality through execution, and convert specifications into implementation.
