# Hierarchical Cognitive Architecture

## Overview

Dynamic hierarchical architecture: unlimited orchestrator depth + strict cognitive compliance at every level.

## Core Principles

MAXIMUM 4 targets per orchestrator + Unlimited depth via recursive deployment + Dynamic creation + Mathematical validation + Adaptive scaling

## Hierarchical Structure

### [L0]: Orchestrator-Zero (Master Coordinator)
EXECUTE: User interface + Analysis + Mission deployment + Progress coordination + Quality assurance

### [L1+]: Dynamic Orchestrator Hierarchy
UNLIMITED depth based on complexity:
- Core Domain Orchestrators (4 standard)
- Dynamic Specialized Orchestrators (created as needed)
- Sub-orchestrator deployment for complex workflows
- Recursive hierarchy for ultra-complex tasks

### [LN]: Protocol-Optimized Agents
UNIVERSAL tool access specialists:
- 6 Core Protocol-Specialized Agents
- Dynamic agents for novel requirements
- Universal tool access + protocol optimization
- Direct Claude Code tool execution

## Cognitive Load Management

### 4-Target Limit Enforcement
MATHEMATICAL compliance: MAX 4 targets per orchestrator + agents/orchestrators/mixed + Automatic sub-orchestrator creation + Load validation

### Dynamic Scaling
**ADAPTIVE depth optimization**:
- Simple tasks: Single orchestrator deployment
- Complex workflows: Multi-level hierarchy creation
- Ultra-complex processes: Recursive orchestrator generation
- Automatic optimization: Real-time depth adjustment based on complexity metrics

## Orchestrator Types

### Core Domain Orchestrators
STANDARD domains:
- Content (documentation + quality)
- Technical (system + commands)
- Intelligence (exploration + analysis) 
- Integration (handoffs + system)

### Dynamic Specialized Orchestrators
GENERATED as needed:
- Domain-specific (ML, blockchain, etc.)
- Workflow-specific (migration, API integration)
- Performance-optimized (high-demand)
- Temporary (one-time complex workflows)

## Communication Protocol

### Hierarchical Communication
STRUCTURED levels: Zero receives requests → Mission deployment → Progress reporting → Result consolidation

### Context Management
EFFICIENT handling: Optimization at each level + 90% handoff triggers + Compression transfer + Mathematical tracking

## Implementation Framework

### Orchestrator Creation
DYNAMIC generation: Analyze complexity → Determine specialization → Generate via templates → Validate compliance

### Hierarchy Management
AUTOMATIC optimization: Monitor cognitive load → Create sub-orchestrators → Optimize paths → Maintain coherence

### Agent Deployment
OPTIMIZED deployment: Deploy at levels → Universal tool access → Protocol specialization → Seamless integration

## Quality Assurance

### Cognitive Compliance Validation
MATHEMATICAL verification: Real-time calculation + Automatic enforcement + Depth optimization + Continuous monitoring

### Performance Optimization
HIERARCHICAL management: Communication efficiency + Context optimization + Resource monitoring + Coherence maintenance

## Success Metrics
