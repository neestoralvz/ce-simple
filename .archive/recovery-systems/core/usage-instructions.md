# Usage Instructions

## Purpose
Provide operational instructions for ce-simple command system execution.

## System Status

**Implementation Ready**:
- Command Structure: Core commands implemented and cross-referenced
- Standards Framework: Writing, notification, anti-bias protocols established
- Workflow Integration: Discovery-to-execution pipeline operational
- Context Architecture: Structured documentation and pattern storage

## Operation Sequence

**Primary Workflow**:
1. Initialize: Execute `/start` with initial request
2. Respond: Answer dynamic discovery questions for context clarification
3. Monitor: Track progress through real-time notifications
4. Review: Evaluate generated context and analysis results
5. Execute: Implement recommendations from workflow

**Command Execution Pattern**: System operates through slash command execution only. All functionality accessed via `/command-name` with autocontained cross-command integration.

## Advanced Operations

**Auto-Activation Framework**:
- Complexity Detection: Automatic workflow depth determination
- Context Sufficiency: Dynamic assessment of information completeness
- Exploration Triggers: Intelligent deployment of research and analysis agents
- Load Balancing: Optimal cognitive resource distribution

**Performance Monitoring**: Track system performance through real-time workflow notifications, context generation metrics, cross-reference matrix validation, and agent deployment analytics.
