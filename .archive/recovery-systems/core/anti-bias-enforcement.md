# Anti-Bias Enforcement

## Purpose
Enforce neutral information processing across all commands through evidence-based analysis.

## Core Restrictions

**NEVER**:
- Use predetermined categories without evidence
- Favor familiar technologies without analysis
- Apply "best practices" without context validation
- Exclude options based on preferences

## Discovery Requirements

**ALWAYS**:
- Use evidence-based analysis with exploration tools
- Apply dynamic pattern recognition from content
- Present neutral options with quantitative criteria
- Make context-driven selections

## Implementation Standards

**Discovery Logic**:
- Codebase: Discover actual structure vs assume patterns
- Web Research: Cover all approaches vs trending solutions
- Analysis: Derive frameworks from data vs predetermined categories

**Content Standards**:
- Language: "Analysis shows", "evidence indicates"
- Recommendations: Include evaluation matrix, requirements, metrics, trade-offs

**Validation Framework**:
- Detection: Monitor assumptions, favoritism, trend influence
- Correction: STOP → IDENTIFY → NEUTRALIZE → RESTART → VALIDATE

## Validation Standards

**Success Metrics**:
- Content: Option coverage, source diversity, evidence density
- Process: Criteria transparency, option equality, validation completeness

**Compliance Checklist**:
- [ ] No predetermined patterns
- [ ] Evidence-based conclusions
- [ ] Neutral language
- [ ] Equal option treatment
- [ ] Explicit criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive alternatives

## Adaptive Framework

**Continuous Improvement**: Identify → Document → Prevent → Integrate bias patterns
**Adaptation**: Customize approaches while preserving neutrality

## Integration Requirements

**Auto-Activation**: All exploration, analysis, documentation activities
**Command Integration**: Discovery → Analysis → Synthesis → Recommendation with neutral protocols

## File Creation Restrictions

**Goal**: Prevent documentation bloat while maintaining functionality

**Prohibited File Types**:
- Meta-documentation about documentation system
- System self-analysis files
- Auto-timestamped files with YYYY-MM-DD patterns
- Duplicate content files
- Empty template placeholder files

**Creation Rules**:
- Maximum 2-3 context files per session
- Files must serve direct user needs
- Unique content only
- Use organized subdirectories (discoveries/, patterns/, research/, workflows/)

**Allowed Context Generation**:
- Genuine discoveries from /explore-codebase
- Research findings from /explore-web
- Learning patterns from /capture-learnings
- Command complexity analysis with metrics
- Implementation recommendations with strategies

**Quality Gates**:
1. Value Assessment: Serves user goals?
2. Uniqueness Check: Information already documented?
3. Quantity Limit: Exceeded 3 files this session?
4. Content Quality: Contains substantial, actionable content?

**Technical Enforcement**:
- Block specific problematic patterns only
- Commands assess value before creating files
- Remove low-value files during maintenance

## Success Criteria

**Compliance Metrics**:
- Zero Assumption Rate: No predetermined categories
- Evidence Coverage: 100% conclusion support
- Option Completeness: Comprehensive alternative coverage
- Language Neutrality: Eliminate bias terminology
- File Proliferation Rate: Zero unauthorized creation
- Structure Compliance: 100% organized subdirectories

## Exploration Protocol

**Critical File Validation**: Never claim file existence without exploration tools

**Required Validation Steps**:
1. Directory Structure: Use `LS()` to verify directories
2. File Existence: Use `Glob()` or `Read()` to confirm files
3. Cross-References: Use `Grep()` to validate links
4. Command Existence: Verify `/command` references in `.claude/commands/`

**Anti-Documentation-Theater Measures**:
- Exploration-Before-Claims: Precede statements with exploration
- Evidence-Based References: Reference only confirmed files
- Real Validation: Use actual tool executions
- Cross-Reference Integrity: Validate all links

**Enforcement Protocol**:
1. LS("target-directory") - Verify directory exists
2. Glob("target-files") - Confirm files exist
3. Grep("reference-pattern") - Validate cross-references
4. Only then make claims about existence

## System Standards

**Core Philosophy** (see `docs/system/architectural-principles.md`):
- Pragmatic Effectiveness: Practical results over theory
- Autocontained Commands: Complete functionality
- LLM Optimized: Documentation for Claude Code
- Anti-Bias Processing: Evidence-based discovery

**Parallelization Requirements** (see `docs/implementation/aggressive-parallelization-protocol.md`):
- Default Parallel Mode: Parallelize all possible operations
- Sequential Only: When explicit dependencies exist
- Performance Target: 5-15x improvement over sequential
- Batch Operations: Multiple tool calls in single messages

**Cross-Command Integration** (see `docs/workflow/primary-discovery-flow.md`):
- Discovery Flow: /start → /explore-codebase + /explore-web → /think-layers → /capture-learnings
- Agent Orchestration: Intelligent deployment based on complexity
- Context Architecture: Organized subdirectories with file controls
- Slash Command Only: All functionality via `/command-name`

**CRITICAL**: Anti-bias rules, exploration protocols, and system standards are MANDATORY for all operations.
