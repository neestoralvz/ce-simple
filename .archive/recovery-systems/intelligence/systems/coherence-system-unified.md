## ⚡ BEHAVIOR PROTOCOL

### Primary Coherence Management
```

CALCULATE → Mathematical coherence score computation  
ASSESS → Impact evaluation of all system changes
PROTECT → Emergency intervention and crisis response
OPTIMIZE → Proactive coherence enhancement and stability
```

### Coherence Calculation Framework

#### Core Coherence Formula
```bash
# Primary coherence calculation using real tools
coherence_score = (consistent_references / total_references) * 100

# Additional coherence factors
structural_coherence = (valid_links / total_links) * 100  
content_coherence = (aligned_concepts / total_concepts) * 100
operational_coherence = (successful_integrations / total_integrations) * 100

# Weighted comprehensive coherence
total_coherence = (structural_coherence * 0.4) + (content_coherence * 0.3) + (operational_coherence * 0.3)
```

#### Real-Time Coherence Monitoring Tools
```bash
# Structural coherence verification
find . -name "*.md" | xargs grep -l "\[.*\](" | wc -l    # Valid references
grep -r "\[.*\](" . | grep -v "http" | wc -l             # Internal links
find . -name "*.md" -exec grep -c "components/" {} \;    # Integration points

# Content coherence verification  
grep -r "Task(" . | wc -l                                # Component dependencies
grep -r "📊.*\[L.*:.*\]" . | wc -l                      # Protocol compliance
find . -name "*.md" -exec wc -l {} \; | awk '{if($1>200) print $2}' | wc -l  # Size violations

# Operational coherence verification
grep -r "VALID\|INVALID" . | wc -l                       # Verification states
grep -r "completed\|pending\|in_progress" . | wc -l     # Operational states
```

### Critical Coherence Thresholds

#### Emergency Response Levels
- **HEALTHY**: >95% coherence - Optimal system state
- **WARNING**: 70-95% coherence - Monitoring required, interventions recommended  
- **CRISIS**: <70% coherence - EMERGENCY STATE, immediate intervention required
- **CRITICAL**: <50% coherence - System integrity at risk, stop all operations

#### Threshold Validation Protocol
```bash
# Automatic coherence assessment
coherence_check() {
    score=$(calculate_coherence_score)
    if [ $score -lt 50 ]; then
        echo "CRITICAL - System integrity at risk"
        trigger_emergency_stop
    elif [ $score -lt 70 ]; then  
        echo "CRISIS - Emergency intervention required"
        trigger_emergency_response
    elif [ $score -lt 95 ]; then
        echo "WARNING - Monitoring and intervention needed"
        trigger_coherence_optimization
    else
        echo "HEALTHY - Optimal coherence maintained"
    fi
}
```

### Coherence Impact Assessment System

#### Pre-Change Impact Analysis
```
EVALUATE → Analyze proposed changes for coherence impact
PREDICT → Calculate expected coherence score change
VALIDATE → Verify change meets minimum coherence requirements  
APPROVE → Authorize changes that maintain >95% coherence
REJECT → Block changes that would drop coherence <95%
```

#### Post-Change Coherence Verification
```
MEASURE → Calculate new coherence score after changes
COMPARE → Compare with pre-change baseline coherence
ANALYZE → Identify specific areas of coherence improvement/degradation
OPTIMIZE → Apply corrective measures if coherence dropped
DOCUMENT → Record coherence impact for system learning
```

### Emergency Coherence Response Protocols

#### Immediate Crisis Response (Coherence <70%)
```
STOP → Halt all non-critical operations immediately
ISOLATE → Identify and contain coherence degradation sources
DIAGNOSE → Analyze specific coherence failure points
RESTORE → Apply emergency coherence restoration procedures
VALIDATE → Verify coherence recovery >95% before resuming operations
```

#### Coherence Crisis Prevention
```
PREDICT → Identify patterns leading to coherence degradation  
INTERVENE → Apply preventive measures before coherence drops
OPTIMIZE → Continuously improve system coherence stability
LEARN → Adapt prevention strategies based on crisis patterns
```
