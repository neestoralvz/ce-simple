    autoActivateScripts({
        validation: context.requiresValidation,
        performance: context.hasPerformanceNeeds,
        compliance: context.requiresCompliance,
        automation: context.hasRepetitiveTasks
    });
}

// BRIDGE UTILIZATION LOGIC:
for (command in activeCommands) {
    availableBridges = getBridgesForCommand(command);
    if (availableBridges.length > 0 && context.allowsAutomation) {
        executeBridge(selectOptimalBridge(availableBridges));
    }
}
```

#### **P56 Transparency Integration**:
```javascript
// TRANSPARENCY ACTIVATION:
function executeWithTransparency(script, context) {
    announceExecution(`⟳ P55 → ${script.name} activating [${context.trigger}]`);
    result = script.execute(context);
    announceCompletion(`✓ P55 → ${script.name} completed [${result.duration}s]`);
    updateDashboard(result.metrics);
    return result;
}

// PROGRESS TRACKING:
function trackProgress(taskChain) {
    for (task in taskChain) {
        displayProgress(`${task.name}: ${task.status} (${task.progress}%)`);
    }
}
```

### **🔄 MONITORING AND OPTIMIZATION**:

#### **Real-time Metrics Framework**:
```bash
# CONTINUOUS MONITORING:
- Script execution rate (target: ≥70%)
- P55/P56 compliance percentage (target: ≥85%)  
- Bridge utilization count (target: ≥150 active)
- Transparency visibility (target: ≥90%)
- User satisfaction with automation (target: ≥95%)

# OPTIMIZATION TRIGGERS:
- If execution rate < 50% → Deploy additional activation triggers
