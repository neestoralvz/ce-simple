// BRIDGE UTILIZATION LOGIC:
for (command in activeCommands) {
    availableBridges = getBridgesForCommand(command);
    if (availableBridges.length > 0 && context.allowsAutomation) {
        executeBridge(selectOptimalBridge(availableBridges));
    }
}
```

#### **P56 Transparency Integration**:
```javascript
