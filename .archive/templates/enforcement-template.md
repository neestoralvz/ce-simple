## üö® MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT PATTERNS

### **üö® MAXIMUM Tier (Highest Priority)**
```markdown
# [Command Type]: `/command-name` 

## **üö® MAXIMUM [Command Category]: [Command Title]**
**üö® MAXIMUM: PRIORIDAD ABSOLUTA - Sistema WILL [core functionality] with STRICTEST enforcement above ALL other principles and ZERO tolerance for violations**
```

### **üö® CRITICAL/BLOCKING Tier**
```markdown
# [Command Type]: `/command-name` 

## **üö® BLOCKING [Command Category]: [Command Title]**
**üö® MANDATORY: Sistema WILL [core functionality] with AUTOMATIC blocking of [violations] and REQUIRED [verification type]**
```

### **üö® MAXIMUM Purpose Section**
```markdown
### **üö® MAXIMUM Purpose**
üö® MAXIMUM: PRIORIDAD ABSOLUTA - Sistema WILL [execute core function] with STRICTEST enforcement above ALL other principles and ZERO tolerance for violations. COMPLETE elimination of [specific violations] with IMMEDIATE blocking and automatic correction.
```

### **üö® CRITICAL/BLOCKING Purpose Section**
```markdown
### **üö® BLOCKING Purpose**
üö® MANDATORY: Sistema WILL [execute core function] with AUTOMATIC [blocking mechanism] and REQUIRED [compliance verification]. BLOCKING of [specific violations] and MANDATORY [enforcement protocols].
```

### **üö® MAXIMUM Section Patterns**
```markdown
**üö® MAXIMUM [Section Name]**: PRIORIDAD ABSOLUTA
- üö® MAXIMUM: [Function] with STRICTEST enforcement above all principles
- üö® BLOCKING: [Function] with ZERO tolerance and immediate correction
- üö® AUTOMATIC: [Function] with real-time optimization and prevention
```

### **üö® CRITICAL/BLOCKING Section Patterns**
```markdown
**üö® MANDATORY [Section Name]**:
- üö® REQUIRED: [Function] with AUTOMATIC [enforcement mechanism]
- üö® BLOCKING: [Function] with real-time [monitoring/detection]
- üö® CRITICAL: [Function] with immediate [correction/activation]
```

### **Process Enforcement**
```markdown
**üö® BLOCKING [Process Name]**:

- **üö® BLOCKING [Step]**: [Description] with real-time [monitoring]
- **üö® CRITICAL [Step]**: [Description] with immediate [validation]
```

### **üö® ERROR PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT** (ENHANCED - Principle #89 Integration)
```markdown
**üö® ZERO TOLERANCE Error Enforcement**:
- **üö® CRITICAL Error Detection**: IMMEDIATE activation of 8-step resolution protocol
- **üö® BLOCKING Continuation**: NO execution continues without protocol completion
- **üö® MANDATORY Protocol Steps**: Steps 1-4 AUTOMATIC, Steps 5-8 MANUAL with verification
- **üö® AUTOMATIC Meta-Command**: /context-eng auto-activation for system-wide error analysis
- **üö® UNIVERSAL Integration**: Seamless integration across all 10 functional domains
```

### **Error Protocol Activation Template**
```markdown
**üö® ERROR PROTOCOL INTEGRATION**:
- **Error Detection**: AUTOMATIC activation when [error type] severity ‚â• HIGH
- **Protocol Trigger**: [Universal Tool Execution](../core/universal-tool-execution.md) integration
- **Enforcement**: ZERO tolerance for error bypass - execution BLOCKED until resolution
- **Verification**: Protocol completion status documented with evidence
- **Cross-Domain**: Protocol active across all functional domains simultaneously
```
