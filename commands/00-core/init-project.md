# /init-project - Complete Project Initialization

## Purpose

Initialize a complete ce-simple project with git repository, CLAUDE.md system file, and full directory structure to establish the foundation for intelligent command orchestration and development workflow.

## Principles and Guidelines

- **Complete Foundation**: Create all essential directories, files, and git configuration for immediate productivity
- **System Integration**: Establish CLAUDE.md as the central orchestration hub with proper cross-references
- **Standard Compliance**: Follow ce-simple architectural patterns and documentation standards throughout
- **Future-Ready**: Structure supports evolution, scaling, and integration with Claude Code workflows

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Environment Setup
Use TodoWrite to create initialization checklist. Initialize git repository, configure basic settings, and establish project root structure. Verify git status and create initial commit with proper attribution.

### Phase 2: Core Structure Creation  
Create complete directory hierarchy including commands/, docs/, and all subdirectories. Generate CLAUDE.md with system overview, architecture references, and command listings. Establish README.md with project introduction.

### Phase 3: Foundation Documentation
Create essential documentation files including core architecture docs, standards, and templates. Establish command-standards.md, documentation-standards.md, and document-template.md for consistent development patterns.

### Phase 4: Validation and Finalization
Run comprehensive validation of all created files and directory structure. Verify cross-references and documentation links. Create final commit with complete project initialization and confirm system readiness.
