# Explore Web - External Pattern Research

## Purpose
Conduct systematic web research for patterns, solutions, and best practices through parallel search operations with intelligent scaling and anti-bias validation.

## Principles and Guidelines
- **Dynamic Parallelization**: Scale from 4-16 concurrent WebSearch operations based on topic complexity assessment
- **Anti-Bias Validation**: Cross-reference findings across multiple independent sources to prevent single-source bias
- **Intelligence-Driven Research**: Add dynamic todos based on topic complexity and discovery quality during research
- **Evidence-Based Recommendations**: All findings backed by verifiable examples with authority verification

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Complexity Assessment and Search Planning
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "Determine research depth and topic complexity (1-10 scale)", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "web-scope-1"},
  {"content": "Calculate optimal search count: 4 (simple), 8 (moderate), 16 (complex)", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "web-parallel-1"}
])
```

### Phase 2: Parallel Search Deployment
```javascript
// Dynamic search execution based on complexity:
// Simple (4 searches): Implementation patterns, use cases, tools/frameworks, best practices
// Moderate (8 searches): Add performance, security, integration, troubleshooting
// Complex (16 searches): Add enterprise patterns, advanced architectures, scaling, expert insights

TodoWrite([
  {"content": "Deploy core searches: implementation patterns, case studies, tech stacks, problem solutions", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "web-core-1"},
  {"content": "Execute context searches: adjacent tech, performance, security, migration (if moderate/complex)", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "web-context-1"},
  {"content": "Deploy advanced searches: enterprise scale, expert insights, trends, success metrics (if complex)", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "web-advanced-1"}
])
```

### Phase 3: Cross-Validation and Synthesis
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "Cross-reference findings across all parallel searches for validation", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "web-validate-1"},
  {"content": "Identify commercial, trend, confirmation, and recency bias patterns", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "web-bias-1"},
  {"content": "Extract architectural, implementation, process, and tool patterns", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "web-patterns-1"}
])
```

### Phase 4: Intelligence Consolidation and Documentation
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "Consolidate research into actionable intelligence with prioritization", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "web-synthesize-1"},
  {"content": "Generate research documentation with anti-bias protocols", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "web-context-1"},
  {"content": "Create structured output to context/research/ directory with findings", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "web-output-1"}
])
```

## Parallelization Intelligence Framework

### Search Complexity Matrix
**Simple Research (4 WebSearch operations)**:
- Implementation patterns and best practices
- Use cases, examples, and tutorials
- Tools, frameworks, and libraries comparison
- Problems, solutions, and troubleshooting

**Moderate Research (8 WebSearch operations)**:
- Core 4 searches plus performance optimization benchmarks
- Security considerations and best practices
- Integration patterns and architecture
- Migration strategies and deployment

**Complex Research (16 WebSearch operations)**:
- All moderate searches plus enterprise patterns and scale architecture
- Expert insights and advanced techniques
- Trends, future developments, and success metrics
- CI/CD automation, monitoring, community resources

### Performance Optimization Targets
- **90% Speed Improvement**: 16 searches in 90 seconds vs 16+ minutes sequential
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multi-angle analysis with cross-validation
- **Smart Adaptation**: Dynamic query refinement based on initial results
- **Quality Assurance**: Authority verification and consensus validation

## Research Quality Framework
**Source Diversity**: Multiple independent sources for validation and bias prevention
**Pattern Recognition**: Extract successful patterns across architectural, implementation, process, and tool domains
**Evidence Validation**: Verify all recommendations through verifiable examples and authority sources
**Bias Detection**: Systematic identification of commercial, trend, confirmation, and recency bias
