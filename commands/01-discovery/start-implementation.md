# Start Implementation Standards

## Purpose
Implementation for `/start` command with Phase 0 structural assessment and failure prevention.

## Phase 0 Integration

### Structural Assessment Protocol
**Execute BEFORE agent orchestration**

**Components**:
- Structural validation: Directories, integrity, violations
- System mapping: Components, dependencies, interfaces
- Exploration validation: Coverage, research depth, references  
- Validation gates: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% checkpoints

**Phase 0 Assessment Protocol**:
- **Structural**: LS root/, docs/, .claude/ for directory validation
- **Coverage**: Glob *.md, Grep for completeness analysis
- **Dependencies**: Map system components and interfaces
- **Thresholds**: Calculate coverage percentage, enforce 85% minimum

### Implementation Tool Calls

#### Structural Validation
Parallel execution: LS for root, docs, context, .claude directories
Violation detection: Glob and Grep for broken/missing elements

#### Threshold Enforcement
85% completeness validation before agent deployment
Metrics: Files analyzed, coverage percentage, dependency completeness

#### Agent Orchestration
Deploy agents only after Phase 0 threshold ≥85%
Fallback to enhanced discovery if threshold not met

## Behavioral Reinforcement

### TodoWrite Template
- Phase-0: Execute structural assessment
- Threshold: Verify 85% completeness
- Orchestration: Deploy agents after validation
- Failure-Prevention: Generate failure mode analysis
- Monitoring: Track checkpoint progress

**TodoWrite Template**:
- **Phase-0**: Execute structural assessment with LS/Glob/Grep
- **Threshold**: Verify 85% completeness before agent deployment
- **Orchestration**: Deploy Task agents after validation passes
- **Prevention**: Generate failure mode analysis and mitigation
- **Monitor**: Track validation checkpoint progress (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)

## Implementation Checkpoints

### Four-Stage Validation
1. **Structural Foundation (25%)**: Directory validation, component identification
2. **Exploration Validation (50%)**: Threshold assessment, dependency mapping
3. **Matrix Completion (75%)**: System mapping, risk assessment
4. **Agent Deployment (100%)**: Complete assessment, orchestration strategy

**Gate Requirements**: Each stage must pass before proceeding to next.

## Failure Prevention

### Risk Assessment
**Key Risks**:
- Insufficient context: RPN 18.9, mitigate with 85% threshold
- Inadequate dependency mapping: RPN 9.6, enhance analysis protocols

### Prevention Documentation
Auto-generated during Phase 0:
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Validation checkpoint results  
- Agent deployment rationale

**Risk Assessment Framework**:
- **Context Risk**: RPN 18.9 (High severity, medium probability, poor detection)
- **Dependency Risk**: RPN 9.6 (Medium severity, low probability, good detection)
- **Prevention**: 85% threshold enforcement, enhanced analysis protocols
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated risk mitigation and validation results

## Tool Call Requirements

### Mandatory Execution
1. **Phase 0 Assessment**: LS calls for structural validation
2. **Completeness Validation**: Glob and Grep for coverage analysis
3. **Threshold Enforcement**: Conditional Task deployment based on 85% threshold

**Tool Call Specifications**:
- **Assessment**: LS(root), LS(docs), LS(.claude) for structure validation
- **Analysis**: Glob(*.md), Grep(implementation|specification) for coverage
- **Validation**: Calculate completeness = analyzed_files/total_files * 100
- **Conditional**: Deploy Task agents only if completeness ≥85%

## Success Criteria

### Prevention Metrics
- Zero context-based failures
- 100% Phase 0 completion before deployment
- 85%+ exploration completeness
- All validation gates passed

### Integration Indicators
- Operational prevention of insufficient context
- Automated threshold enforcement
- Risk mitigation for high-risk modes
- Complete prevention documentation
