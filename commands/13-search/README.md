# 13-search - Information Discovery Commands

## Purpose
Advanced information retrieval and content discovery. These commands enable sophisticated search operations, content indexing, and intelligent information filtering across codebases and documentation.

## Commands
- `/search-advanced` - Complex search operations with multi-criteria filtering
- `/index-content` - Content indexing and organization for rapid retrieval
- `/discover-information` - Information discovery and intelligent retrieval
- `/filter-results` - Result filtering and refinement with relevance scoring

## Category Relations
- **Enables**: 01-discovery information gathering capabilities
- **Supports**: 06-documentation with content discovery
- **Assists**: All categories with information retrieval needs
- **Integrates with**: 14-utils for common search operations

## Usage Patterns
```
01-discovery/explore-codebase → 13-search/index-content → Structured knowledge base
06-documentation/maintain-docs → 13-search/discover-information → Content gaps identified
13-search/search-advanced → 13-search/filter-results → Refined results
Complex queries → 13-search/discover-information → Intelligent retrieval
```

## Search Capabilities
- **Advanced Queries**: Multi-criteria search with boolean logic
- **Content Indexing**: Automated organization and tagging
- **Semantic Discovery**: Context-aware information retrieval
- **Result Refinement**: Intelligent filtering and ranking

## Information Sources
- Codebase: Source files, comments, documentation
- Documentation: Technical docs, READMEs, guides
- Configuration: Settings, metadata, schemas
- External: Web resources, API documentation

## Output Formats
- Structured search results with relevance scores
- Content maps with relationship graphs
- Filtered datasets with applied criteria
- Discovery reports with actionable insights
