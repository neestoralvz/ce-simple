# 14-utils - Common Operations & Utilities

## Purpose
Shared utilities and helper functions supporting all categories. These commands provide essential system services, diagnostic tools, and common operations for cross-category functionality.

## Commands
- `/calc-engine` - Mathematical computation and calculation utilities
- `/deploy-core` - Deployment coordination and environment management
- `/monitor-core` - System monitoring and health diagnostics
- `/todo-manager` - Task management and workflow coordination
- `/validator-core` - Validation services and quality assurance utilities

## Category Relations
- **Supports**: All categories with common functionality
- **Coordinates with**: 07-maintenance for system operations
- **Provides**: Shared services and utilities system-wide
- **Integrates**: External tools and system capabilities

## Usage Patterns
```
Any category → 14-utils/calc-engine → Mathematical operations
04-execution/deploy-system → 14-utils/deploy-core → Environment coordination  
07-maintenance/monitor-health → 14-utils/monitor-core → System diagnostics
All workflows → 14-utils/todo-manager → Task coordination
05-validation/quality-gate → 14-utils/validator-core → Quality checks
```

## Utility Categories
- **Computational**: Mathematical operations and data processing
- **Deployment**: Environment management and coordination
- **Monitoring**: System health and performance tracking
- **Task Management**: Workflow coordination and task orchestration
- **Validation**: Quality assurance and compliance checking

## Integration Points
- Cross-category service provider
- System diagnostic and troubleshooting hub
- Common operation standardization
- External tool integration gateway

## Service Model
- **On-demand**: Called by other categories as needed
- **Shared State**: Maintains common data and configurations
- **Standardized**: Consistent interfaces across all utilities
- **Reliable**: Error handling and graceful degradation
