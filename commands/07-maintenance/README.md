# 07-maintenance - Maintenance & Optimization Commands

## Purpose
System maintenance, optimization, and continuous improvement. These commands ensure long-term system health, performance optimization, and automated maintenance procedures.

## Commands
- `/matrix-maintenance` - Cross-reference validation and system integrity checking
- `/context-optimize` - Intelligent context consolidation and memory optimization
- `/command-maintain` - Command maintenance, optimization, and standards compliance
- `/worktree-cleanup` - Automated git worktree cleanup and maintenance
- `/system-optimize` - Comprehensive system optimization
- `/maintenance-auto` - Automated maintenance procedures
- `/performance-tune` - Performance tuning and optimization
- `/cleanup-intelligent` - Intelligent cleanup and organization
- `/health-monitor` - Continuous health monitoring and alerts

## Category Relations
- **Triggered by**: 05-validation, 08-learning for improvements
- **Coordinates with**: 12-math for performance metrics
- **Uses**: 14-utils for maintenance utilities
- **Reports to**: 00-core for system status

## Usage Patterns
```
11-meta/command-create → 07-maintenance/matrix-maintenance → integrity validation
08-learning/patterns → 07-maintenance/context-optimize → memory optimization
05-validation/complete → 07-maintenance/command-maintain → standards compliance
09-git/worktree-close → 07-maintenance/worktree-cleanup → repository health
12-math/metrics → 07-maintenance/system-optimize → performance tuning
```

## Maintenance Categories
- **Cross-Reference Integrity**: Matrix maintenance and validation (matrix-maintenance)
