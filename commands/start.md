# Start

## Purpose
Primary discovery command that analyzes request complexity, orchestrates parallel agents, and executes optimized workflows for maximum efficiency.

## Auto-Triggered Commands

**Complexity ≥6**: `/worktree-start` for isolated development environment
**Analysis Required**: Agent orchestration for parallel intelligence gathering
**Learning Value ≥4**: `/capture-learnings` for pattern documentation
**Multi-Domain**: `/explore-codebase` + `/explore-web` combination workflows

## Execution Process

1. **Assess complexity** using request analysis and keyword detection
2. **Deploy agents** for parallel research and analysis tasks
3. **Question dynamically** to clarify requirements and constraints
4. **Validate structure** ensuring project integrity and standards compliance
5. **Execute pathway** using optimized workflow based on complexity
6. **Monitor progress** with real-time adaptation and optimization
