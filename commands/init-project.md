# init-project

**Purpose**: Project initialization with Git WorkTrees setup for parallel development

## User Vision Implementation

From `user-input/technical-requirements/technical-architecture-user.md`:
- "Git WorkTrees for Parallel Development: Enable conflict-free parallel operations"
- "File operations: 5-10 parallel (10x speedup)"
- "Isolated file operations preventing merge conflicts"

## Execution Process

### Real Parallelization Strategy
Deploy 5 parallel sub-agents via Task Tool for comprehensive project setup:

1. **Git Infrastructure Agent** - Initialize repository, branches, and WorkTree structure
2. **Directory Structure Agent** - Create project directories and base file structure  
3. **Configuration Agent** - Setup configuration files and development environment
4. **Documentation Agent** - Create initial documentation and README structure
5. **Validation Agent** - Verify setup and run initial validation checks

### Task Tool Implementation

```markdown
I'll deploy 5 specialized setup agents to initialize your project in parallel.

**TRANSPARENCY GUARANTEE**: You will see each agent's setup progress and results in real-time.

**Agent 1 - Git Infrastructure Setup**
Task: Initialize Git repository, main branch, and WorkTree structure
Tools: Bash (git commands), Write | **Reports to**: User directly
Focus: Git repository setup, branch structure, WorkTree configuration

**Agent 2 - Directory Structure Creation**
Task: Create core project directories and base file structure
Tools: Write, Bash (mkdir), LS | **Reports to**: User directly
Focus: Project organization, directory hierarchy, base files

**Agent 3 - Configuration Setup** 
Task: Create configuration files and development environment setup
Tools: Write, Read | **Reports to**: User directly
Focus: Package managers, build tools, environment configuration

**Agent 4 - Documentation Creation**
Task: Create initial documentation structure and README files  
Tools: Write | **Reports to**: User directly
Focus: Project documentation, README, initial guides

**Agent 5 - Validation & Verification**
Task: Verify setup completion and run initial validation checks
Tools: Bash, Read, LS | **Reports to**: User directly
Focus: Setup verification, initial validation, error checking

EXECUTION PATTERN:
1. Deploy Agents 1-4 in parallel for independent setup tasks
2. Each agent reports progress and completion status to user
3. Agent 5 validates all work after agents 1-4 complete
4. User sees individual agent work AND final validation confirmation
5. Complete transparency into project initialization process
```

## Git WorkTrees Integration

Based on user requirements for "conflict-free parallel operations":

- **Main WorkTree**: Primary development in main directory
- **Feature WorkTrees**: Isolated branches for parallel feature development  
- **Analysis WorkTree**: Dedicated space for code analysis without main branch interference
- **Documentation WorkTree**: Separate space for documentation updates
- **Experimental WorkTree**: Safe space for experimental changes

## Expected Results

- **Complete project structure** with proper Git repository and WorkTree setup
- **Development environment** ready for parallel operations
- **Configuration files** for build tools, dependencies, and development
- **Initial documentation** including README and project guides
- **Validation confirmation** that all setup completed successfully

## Success Metrics

- 5 parallel agents complete initialization in under 3 minutes
- Git WorkTrees properly configured for conflict-free parallel development
- Complete project structure ready for immediate development
- All configuration files properly created and validated
- 10x faster than sequential setup (user target achieved)

**Implementation Truth**: Uses real Task Tool parallelization with actual Git WorkTree setup, not simulated architecture.
