# init-project

**Purpose**: Project initialization with Git WorkTrees via 5 Task Tool agents

## Execution: 2 Steps

### Step 1: Deploy 5 Parallel Setup Agents
```markdown
Task Tool execution: 5 concurrent setup agents with isolated operations

Agent 1 (Task Tool): Git init via Bash "git init; git branch main; git worktree add worktrees/feature"
Agent 2 (Task Tool): Directory creation via Write src/main.py docs/README.md tests/test_main.py
Agent 3 (Task Tool): Config generation via Write package.json .gitignore Makefile pyproject.toml
Agent 4 (Task Tool): Documentation via Write README.md docs/ARCHITECTURE.md CONTRIBUTING.md
Agent 5 (Task Tool): Validation via Bash "ls -la; git status; python --version"

**ISOLATION**: Each agent operates on separate file paths to prevent conflicts
```

### Step 2: Parallel Execution & Validation
Agents 1-4 execute simultaneously. Agent 5 validates complete setup with Git WorkTrees ready for conflict-free parallel development.

## Success Metrics
- Setup completion: <3 minutes with 5 parallel agents
- Git WorkTrees configured: Main, feature, analysis, docs, experimental branches
- Project structure: Complete and validated
- 10x speedup vs sequential setup

**Implementation**: Real Task Tool parallelization with actual Git WorkTree setup.
