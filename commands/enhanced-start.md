# Enhanced-Start

## Purpose
Advanced discovery command that integrates Phase 0 structural assessment, intelligent autotrigger execution, and parallel orchestration for maximum workflow optimization and failure prevention.

## Input Requirements
- User context/request (any complexity level)
- Project structure accessibility
- Required tools: LS, Glob, Grep, Task, TodoWrite

## Auto-Triggered Commands

**Phase 0 Assessment**: Mandatory structural validation before agent deployment
**Complexity ≥6**: `/worktree-start` for isolated development environment  
**Analysis Required**: Agent orchestration with parallel intelligence gathering
**Learning Value ≥4**: `/capture-learnings` for pattern documentation
**Multi-Domain**: `/explore-codebase` + `/explore-web` combination workflows
**Integration Gaps**: `/matrix-maintenance` for cross-reference validation
**Context Optimization**: `/context-optimize` for documentation consolidation

## Core Orchestration

### Task Distribution Strategy
Deploy intelligent parallel task execution:
- Phase 0: Structural assessment and completeness validation (85% threshold)
- Phase 1: Discovery tasks based on request complexity analysis
- Phase 2: Analysis and understanding tasks with intelligent coordination  
- Phase 3: Implementation tasks with autotrigger execution
- Phase 4: Validation and quality assurance with learning capture

### Execution Pattern
1. **Phase 0 Assessment**: Execute mandatory structural validation protocols
2. **Complexity Analysis**: Determine request scope and required workflows
3. **Autotrigger Deployment**: Execute relevant commands based on complexity matrix
4. **Parallel Orchestration**: Deploy intelligent agent coordination
5. **Results Aggregation**: Compile findings with learning pattern extraction

## Task Instructions

### Phase 0 Structural Assessment
Execute mandatory validation before any agent deployment:
- Validate project directory structure and integrity
- Assess completeness threshold (85% minimum required)
- Generate failure prevention risk analysis
- Enable autotrigger execution only after validation gates passed

### Autotrigger Execution Logic
Deploy commands based on intelligent analysis:
- **Worktree Management**: Auto-initialize isolated environments for complex development
- **Research Coordination**: Deploy parallel explore-codebase and explore-web for comprehensive analysis
- **Learning Integration**: Auto-capture patterns and insights for system evolution
- **Matrix Maintenance**: Auto-trigger cross-reference validation and integrity checks

### Orchestration Logic
Multi-wave execution with intelligent coordination:
- **Wave 1**: Phase 0 assessment and structural validation
- **Wave 2**: Complexity analysis and autotrigger deployment
- **Wave 3**: Parallel discovery and analysis execution
- **Wave 4**: Implementation coordination with continuous validation

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
Handle failures with intelligent adaptation:
- Continue with successful validation gates if partial Phase 0 completion
- Adapt autotrigger strategy based on available system components
- Provide comprehensive partial results when complete execution blocked
- Maintain transparent communication about system limitations and adaptations

### Recovery Strategies
Comprehensive failure mode management:
- **Phase 0 Failures**: Execute alternative validation paths and reduced complexity workflows
- **Autotrigger Failures**: Deploy manual coordination with enhanced monitoring
- **Agent Coordination Failures**: Fall back to sequential execution with progress tracking
- **Integration Failures**: Implement isolated execution with post-completion integration

## Performance Optimization

### Parallel Efficiency
Maximize concurrent execution effectiveness:
- Optimize autotrigger deployment for minimal resource overlap
- Structure Phase 0 assessment for independent parallel validation
- Plan intelligent agent coordination to minimize context switching
- Balance discovery depth vs breadth for optimal resource utilization

### Resource Management
Intelligent resource allocation and optimization:
- Prioritize Phase 0 completion before resource-intensive agent deployment
- Allocate context tokens efficiently across parallel discovery tasks
- Plan progressive disclosure of results for optimal user experience
- Monitor autotrigger execution for resource optimization opportunities

## User Experience

### Progress Communication
Real-time execution transparency:
- Explain Phase 0 assessment strategy and completion status
- Provide autotrigger deployment rationale and execution progress
- Show intermediate validation gate results and system health
- Communicate completion status with learning pattern highlights

### Result Presentation
Structured output with actionable insights:
- Lead with executive summary of request fulfillment and system optimization
- Organize findings by Phase 0 validation, autotrigger results, and discovery insights
- Highlight key learning patterns and system evolution opportunities
- Provide clear next steps with continued optimization recommendations

## Integration Standards

### Context Management
Comprehensive context handling and evolution:
- Load Phase 0 assessment results for intelligent decision making
- Update context with autotrigger execution patterns and optimization insights
- Commit valuable discoveries and system evolution patterns to Git
- Maintain cross-session continuity with enhanced learning integration

### Quality Assurance
Systematic reliability and excellence assurance:
- Validate Phase 0 assessment completion before agent deployment
- Check autotrigger execution results for completeness and integration
- Verify user requirements fulfillment with comprehensive validation
- Test edge cases and error conditions with systematic recovery protocols

## Execution Layer

### Mandatory Phase 0 Assessment
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Execute structural validation before any agent deployment
LS("/Users/nalve/ce-simple")           // Root structure validation
LS("/Users/nalve/ce-simple/docs")      // Docs directory validation  
LS("/Users/nalve/ce-simple/context")   // Context directory validation
LS("/Users/nalve/ce-simple/commands")  // Commands directory validation

// Completeness threshold enforcement
Glob("**/*.md", {path: "."})
Grep("implementation|specification", {glob: "**/*.md", output_mode: "count"})
```

### Autotrigger Intelligence Engine
```javascript
// Deploy autotriggers based on intelligent analysis
if (complexity_score >= 6) {
  Task("Worktree Management", "Execute /worktree-start for isolated development environment")
}

if (analysis_required) {
  Task("Codebase Analysis", "Execute /explore-codebase for internal project analysis")
  Task("External Research", "Execute /explore-web for external information gathering")
}

if (learning_value >= 4) {
  Task("Pattern Capture", "Execute /capture-learnings for system evolution documentation")
}

if (integration_gaps_detected) {
  Task("Matrix Validation", "Execute /matrix-maintenance for cross-reference integrity")
}

// Context optimization after execution
Task("Context Consolidation", "Execute /context-optimize for documentation cleanup")
```

### Agent Orchestration Deployment
```javascript
// Only deploy after Phase 0 validation gates passed
if (phase_0_completeness >= 85) {
  Task("Intelligent Coordination", "Deploy agent orchestration with Phase 0 context and autotrigger integration")
} else {
  Task("Enhanced Discovery", "Increase completeness to threshold before agent deployment")
}
```

### Behavioral Reinforcement Protocol
