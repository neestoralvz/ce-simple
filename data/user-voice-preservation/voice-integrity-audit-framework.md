# Voice Integrity Assessment and Audit Framework

**Date**: 2025-07-26 | **Type**: Comprehensive Audit System | **Authority**: Agent 8 Implementation
**Status**: Active Audit Framework | **Lines**: ≤185

## Purpose Statement

**Think×4 Analysis Applied:**
- **Think**: Voice integrity assessment ensures authentic user voice preservation and prevents system manipulation
- **Think Hard**: Audit framework must provide comprehensive validation while maintaining user privacy and system performance
- **Think Harder**: Integrity assessment must integrate with Sacred User Space protection and existing VDD quality gates
- **Ultra Think**: Comprehensive audit framework enables trust in voice-based systems through transparent validation and continuous monitoring
