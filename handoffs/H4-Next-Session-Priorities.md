# H4-Next-Session-Priorities

**Created**: 2025-07-26 | **Authority**: Session Continuation Protocol | **Urgency**: Immediate

## Immediate Session Priorities

### Priority 1: Wave 2 Orchestration Launch
**Objective**: Begin Wave 2 execution immediately upon session start
**Context**: 15 remaining tasks across 3 waves require orchestration
**Action Items**:
- Load H3-Pending-Orchestration-Waves.md context
- Initialize sub-agent coordination protocols  
- Execute Task 7: Sub-agent Migration Strategy
- Begin parallel development on Tasks 8-9

### Priority 2: Context-Limited Session Protocol
**Objective**: Manage context economy during intensive orchestration
**Strategy**:
- Use targeted file imports based on active wave
- Implement context rotation for large task sets
- Maintain essential context anchors (CLAUDE_RULES.md, project structure)
- Utilize handoff documents for state preservation

### Priority 3: VDD Framework Completion Roadmap
**Current Status**: Wave 1 Complete (6/21 tasks) | Wave 2-4 Pending (15 tasks)
**Timeline**:
- **Wave 2**: 2-3 sessions (Migration, Config, Navigation)
- **Wave 3**: 2-3 sessions (Commands, Protocols, Standards) 
- **Wave 4**: 3-4 sessions (Integration, Validation, Verification)
- **Total Estimated**: 7-10 sessions for completion

## User Concern Resolution

### File Fragmentation Analysis
**User Concern**: "File fragmentation across multiple directories"
**Priority**: High - Address during POST-IMPLEMENTATION phase
**Action Plan**:
1. Complete current orchestration waves (maintain momentum)
2. Execute comprehensive fragmentation analysis
3. Implement consolidation strategy
4. Validate navigation efficiency improvements

### Analysis Scope**:
- Current file count: ~150+ files across 8 directories
- Navigation complexity assessment
- Maintenance overhead evaluation
- User experience impact measurement

## Testing & Validation Requirements

### Continuous Validation During Waves
- **Wave 2**: Configuration testing, migration validation
- **Wave 3**: Protocol testing, command interface validation  
- **Wave 4**: System integration testing, performance validation

### Comprehensive Testing Framework
**Components**:
- Unit tests for individual sub-agents
- Integration tests for wave completion
- System tests for full VDD framework
- Performance benchmarks for optimization

### Success Criteria
- All 21 tasks completed successfully
- Sub-agent coordination functional
- Performance metrics meet targets
- User acceptance criteria satisfied

## GitHub Pages Deployment Finalization

### Current Status
**Repository**: ce-simple configured for GitHub Pages
**Pending Tasks**:
- Final content validation
- Navigation system testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation completeness verification

### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All markdown files properly formatted
- [ ] Navigation links functional
- [ ] Images and assets optimized
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] Search functionality operational
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Token Economy Optimization

### Current Challenges
- Context switching overhead during orchestration
- Large handoff document management
- Multi-session state preservation
- Sub-agent coordination complexity

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Selective Context Loading**: Import only active wave context
2. **Handoff Rotation**: Archive completed wave handoffs
3. **Context Compression**: Summarize completed work
4. **Sub-agent Specialization**: Reduce cross-agent context needs

### Implementation Plan
- Monitor token usage during Wave 2-4 execution
- Implement optimization strategies as needed
- Maintain performance metrics
- Adjust protocols based on efficiency measurements

## Session Continuation Protocol

### Immediate Actions for New Session
1. **Load Essential Context**:
   - Read H3-Pending-Orchestration-Waves.md
   - Import CLAUDE_RULES.md:1-25
   - Load current project structure

2. **Initialize Orchestration**:
   - Begin Wave 2 Task 7 execution
   - Establish sub-agent coordination
   - Set up parallel task management

3. **Monitor Progress**:
   - Track task completion status
   - Update handoff documents
   - Maintain context economy

### Context Preservation Strategy
- **Active Context**: Current wave tasks and dependencies
- **Archived Context**: Completed waves and historical decisions
- **Reference Context**: Standards, templates, and protocols
- **Emergency Context**: Critical user preferences and constraints

## Risk Management

### Potential Blockers
- Context limit exceeded during complex orchestration
- Sub-agent coordination failures
- Task dependency conflicts  
- User availability for validation

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement context rotation protocols
- Maintain backup handoff documentation
- Create fallback execution paths
- Establish clear validation checkpoints

## Success Metrics

### Wave Completion Indicators
- All tasks within wave completed successfully
- Sub-agent coordination functional
- Documentation updated appropriately
- User feedback incorporated

### Framework Completion Goals
- VDD framework fully operational
- File fragmentation addressed
- GitHub Pages deployment complete
- Token economy optimized
- User satisfaction achieved
