# Context Flow Decision Record - Handoff

**Created**: 2025-07-24 | **Type**: Governance Documentation | **Estimated**: 1.5 hours

## Objective

Document the architectural decisions and design rationale for how information flows between components in the ce-simple system, creating authoritative record for context management architecture.

## Context

With Context Mapping Methodology Framework established, need formal decision record that documents WHY information flows as it does, preserving architectural reasoning for future development and preventing authority hierarchy violations.

## Deliverable

**File**: `docs/governance/context-flow-decision-record.md`

## Requirements

### Authority Flow Documentation
- Formal documentation of docs/vision/ → CLAUDE_RULES → docs/core/ → CLAUDE hierarchy
- Rationale for each authority level and its responsibilities
- Integration with conditional loading system

### Reference Network Design
- Documentation of hub-and-spoke vs. direct reference patterns
- Design rationale for @ imports vs. reference links vs. READ instructions
- Authority preservation during reference changes

### Information Architecture Decisions
- Why certain content loads immediately vs. conditionally
- Decision criteria for context classification (MANDATORY/CONDITIONAL/REFERENCE/ELIMINATE)
- Integration with three-layer architecture

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Clear architectural decision documentation
- [ ] Rationale preserved for future reference
- [ ] Authority hierarchy violations prevented
- [ ] Integration with existing governance system
- [ ] PTS compliance throughout

## Integration Points

- **Governance System**: Follows ADR format in docs/governance/
- **Context Mapping**: References methodology framework
- **Authority Hierarchy**: Documents vision-driven decisions

## Execution Notes

Focus on capturing architectural WHY, not just HOW. This document prevents future violations of established information flow patterns.
