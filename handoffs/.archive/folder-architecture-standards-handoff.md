# Folder Architecture Standards - Handoff

**Created**: 2025-07-24 | **Type**: Standards Implementation | **Estimated**: 2 hours

## Objective

Create comprehensive standards for folder structure growth and evolution within ce-simple project, ensuring scalable architecture that maintains organization without breaking changes.

## Context

Following completion of Context Mapping Methodology Framework, need specific standards for how directories can grow, when to create new directories vs. using existing ones, and maintenance of authority hierarchy through structural changes.

## Deliverable

**File**: `docs/standards/folder-architecture-standards.md`

## Requirements

### Growth Pattern Framework
- Specific rules for each existing directory type (docs/core/, docs/rules/, etc.)
- Criteria for when to create new directories vs. add to existing
- Authority hierarchy preservation during structural changes

### Directory Function Definitions
- Clear purpose statements for each directory
- File count guidelines and expansion limits
- Cross-directory reference management

### Evolution Protocols
- Standards for renaming or reorganizing directories
- Reference update procedures during changes
- Integration with existing context management system

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Clear decision matrix for directory growth choices
- [ ] Integration with existing context mapping methodology
- [ ] PTS 12/12 compliance throughout
- [ ] Authority hierarchy preservation guaranteed
- [ ] Zero broken references during structural changes

## Integration Points

- **Context Mapping**: Builds on `docs/methodologies/context-mapping-framework.md`
- **Standards System**: Follows three-layer architecture
- **Authority Hierarchy**: Respects docs/vision/ → CLAUDE_RULES → docs/core/ flow

## Execution Notes

Apply UltraThink x4 methodology for structural decisions. Focus on preventing future architectural chaos while maintaining current system functionality.
