# Handoff: Error Resolution Command Suite Development

**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Dependencies**: Handoff #1 (PTS Validation) and #2 (Structural Cleanup)  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours  
**Complexity**: High (PTS compliance challenge)

## Objective
Create comprehensive error resolution command suite implementing the 5-phase error resolution workflow while maintaining PTS compliance and integrating with established modular architecture.

## Foundation Context

### **Error Resolution Workflow Established**
- Pattern documented in docs/patterns/error-resolution-workflow.md
- 5-Phase methodology: Deep exploration ‚Üí External research ‚Üí Think x4 analysis ‚Üí Integral solutions ‚Üí Logging escalation
- Visual validation integration (screenshots, console analysis)
- Root cause focus with preventive monitoring

### **PTS Compliance Challenge**
**Core Tension**: Error resolution inherently complex vs. PTS simplicity requirements

**Challenge Analysis**:
- Error resolution requires comprehensive systematic investigation
- PTS demands simple, focused solutions with ‚â§150 lines per command
- Must maintain single responsibility while providing complete debugging workflow
- Autocontained principle conflicts with external research requirements

**Resolution Strategy**: Modular command suite with focused responsibilities and clear orchestration

## Command Suite Architecture

### **Modular Approach** (5 specialized commands)
```
/debug-explore   - Evidence gathering and initial exploration (Phase 1)
/debug-research  - External research and best practice identification (Phase 2)
/debug-analyze   - Think x4 analysis and solution design (Phase 3)
/debug-implement - Solution implementation and validation (Phase 4)
/debug-monitor   - Ongoing monitoring and prevention (Phase 5)
```

### **PTS Compliance Strategy**

#### **Simplicity Through Modularity**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each command handles ONE phase of error resolution
- **Clear Boundaries**: Focused functionality per command with explicit handoff points
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, add complexity only as needed
- **Orchestration Pattern**: Commands can be used independently or in sequence

#### **Target Specifications**
- **Line Limits**: ‚â§150 lines per command (strict PTS requirement)
- **Autocontained Logic**: All phase-specific logic embedded within each command
- **External Integration**: Clear protocols for research and tool integration
- **Pattern Capture**: Automatic knowledge capture without complexity overhead
