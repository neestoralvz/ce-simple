# Next Actions Registry - Prioritized Active Planning

**31/07/2025 CDMX** | Auto-depurated: Focus on executable next actions

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/roadmap/ROADMAP_REGISTRY.md â†’ dashboard/next-actions-registry.md implements active planning per cleanup automation

## ðŸŽ¯ PRIORITIZED NEXT ACTIONS FRAMEWORK

### Priority 1: P0B COMPLETION CONTINUATION (CRITICAL)
â†’ **Execute**: @context/roadmap/handoffs/p0b/README.md modular handoff system  
**Status**: 50% â†’ 100% completion path documented with systematic processing  
**Impact**: Unlocks 7 critical issues + P1-P7 phases cascade (total 18 blocked items)
**Timeline**: 3-4 days maximum completion

### Priority 2: Independent Issues Parallel Execution (IMMEDIATE)
**Execute**: 8 independent issues (#13, #10, #11, #19, #21, #7, #8, #9)
**Advantage**: Zero dependency blocking, immediate execution capability
**Impact**: Parallel progress while addressing P0B bottleneck
**Timeline**: 1-2 days each, can run simultaneously

### Priority 3: Core Factorization Phase 1 (READY)
**Execute**: H-FALLBACK-CMD + H-HOOK-INTEGR + H-AUTOCONTAIN
**Benefit**: Modern command architecture, graceful degradation
**Dependencies**: Scripts classification completed, core dispatcher ready
**Timeline**: 2-3 days combined effort

### Priority 4: System Testing Preparation (SEQUENTIAL)
**Execute**: H-SYSTEM-TEST preparation once H-AUTOCONTAIN completes
**Benefit**: Complete system validation and integration testing
**Dependencies**: H-AUTOCONTAIN completion required
**Timeline**: 4-5 days (high complexity)

## EXECUTION STRATEGY ANALYSIS

### ðŸ”§ Immediate Execution Available
- **P0B Continuation**: Modular handoff system ready for execution
- **Independent Issues**: 8 issues with zero blocking dependencies
- **Core Factorization**: Ready handoffs with dependencies satisfied

### ðŸš€ Parallel Opportunities
- **P0B + Independent**: Can run simultaneously (different domains)
- **Core Factorization**: Multiple handoffs can execute in parallel
- **System Preparation**: Background preparation while executing priorities

### ðŸ“Š Impact Metrics
- **P0B Completion**: Unlocks 18 blocked items (51% of remaining work)
- **Independent Issues**: 8 items immediate progress (23% of active work)
- **Core Factorization**: Modern architecture foundation (critical system upgrade)

**NEXT ACTIONS FOCUS**: Prioritized executable actions, completed planning archived
