# Documentation Consolidation Implementation Standards

## 🔧 Parallel Consolidation Framework

### Core Consolidation Tasks (Sequential Execution)
**MANDATORY**: Execute in dependency order to prevent reference breaks

**Essential Operations**:
- **Content Overlap Analysis**: Identify duplicate concepts and determine authoritative sources
- **Reference Chain Mapping**: Trace all cross-references and identify repair requirements
- **Progressive Extraction**: Move detailed content from commands to standards/context layers
- **Authority Establishment**: Designate single sources of truth for each concept domain

## 🎯 Consolidation Strategies

### Duplication Resolution Matrix
**HIGH Priority** (>40% overlap):
- Merge files with substantial content duplication
- Establish single authoritative source
- Create reference links from eliminated locations
- Preserve unique value-adding content

**MEDIUM Priority** (20-40% overlap):
- Consolidate overlapping sections within files
- Standardize terminology and explanations
- Cross-reference shared concepts
- Eliminate redundant examples

**LOW Priority** (<20% overlap):
- Optimize cross-reference patterns
- Standardize formatting and structure
- Unify symbol usage and conventions
- Streamline navigation paths

### Reference Repair Operations
**Broken Reference Patterns**:
```bash
# Identify broken internal links
grep -r "\.md\b" --include="*.md" . | grep -v "archive"

# Validate file existence for references
find . -name "*.md" -exec basename {} \; | sort
```

**Repair Strategies**:
- **Create Missing Files**: Generate referenced files with appropriate content
- **Update References**: Modify links to point to consolidated locations
- **Bidirectional Linking**: Ensure reverse navigation capabilities
- **Authority Chain**: Establish clear hierarchy for cross-references

## 📊 Content Extraction Guidelines

### Progressive Disclosure Implementation
**Commands** (≤140 lines optimal):
- Extract educational content → Move to context layer
- Extract detailed criteria → Move to standards layer
- Extract examples → Move to pattern documentation
- Maintain execution focus and coordination instructions

**Standards** (≤200 lines):
- Consolidate framework documentation
- Unify criteria and metrics
- Establish authoritative guidelines
- Cross-reference related concepts

**Context** (≤200 lines):
- Consolidate learning patterns
- Document discovered relationships
- Capture implementation examples
- Preserve historical decisions

## 📏 File Size Optimization

### Size Violation Resolution
**Commands Exceeding Limits**:
- Apply progressive disclosure principles
- Extract verbose sections to external files
- Optimize redundant explanations
- Maintain coordination functionality

**Documentation Exceeding Limits**:
- Identify consolidation opportunities
- Merge related concept files
- Eliminate redundant sections
- Preserve information completeness

## ✅ Quality Assurance Protocols

### Consolidation Validation
**Post-Consolidation Checklist**:
- [ ] All references functional and verified
- [ ] No information loss during consolidation
- [ ] File size compliance achieved
- [ ] Architectural boundaries maintained
- [ ] Navigation efficiency improved

**Success Metrics**:
- Content duplication reduced to <5%
- 100% functional cross-references
- File size compliance achieved
- Navigation steps ≤2.5 cognitive units
- System coherence maintained
