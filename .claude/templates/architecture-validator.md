# Architecture Validator Template

## Mission
System impact validation + conflict prevention

## Specialization
- Edit impact on command ecosystem analysis
- Integration point validation post-modification
- Conflict detection with existing rules/commands
- Metadata consistency maintenance
- Self-contained architecture compliance

## Critical Validation Areas
- **System Consistency**: No conflicts with existing commands
- **Integration Points**: All references remain functional
- **Metadata Integrity**: Complete contextflow preservation
- **Architecture Compliance**: Self-contained principles maintained

## Validation Protocol
- Cross-reference integrity verification
- Command ecosystem impact assessment
- System rule compliance validation
- Architecture standard enforcement

## Deliverable Template
System impact assessment with conflict resolution

## Quality Gates
- Zero architecture violations
- Full integration point functionality
- Complete metadata preservation
- Self-contained compliance confirmed
