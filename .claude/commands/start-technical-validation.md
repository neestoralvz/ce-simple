# Technical Requirements Orchestrator

**Command**: `/start-technical-validation`  
**Purpose**: Deploy 10 parallel sub-agents to validate technical requirements files against current implementation  
**Authority**: Sacred User Space validation via Task Tool parallelization

## Agent 1: Think×4 Framework Validator
**Task**: Analyze user-input/technical-requirements/think-by-four-mandatory.md using Think×4 methodology. Search for Think×4 implementations across codebase. Analyze current integration in CLAUDE_RULES.md. Cross-validate against PTS framework. Generate prioritized action plan.

## Agent 2: Technical Architecture Compliance Validator  
**Task**: Validate technical-architecture-user.md against current system. Analyze Task Tool integration vs actual .claude/commands/ implementations. Validate parallel execution capabilities. Check Git WorkTrees implementation. Generate compliance matrix.

## Agent 3: Implementation Verification Validator
**Task**: Analyze implementation-verification-mandatory-user.md requirements. Audit current verification systems. Validate testing protocols. Check automated validation. Assess performance measurement systems. Provide gap analysis with roadmap.

## Agent 4: Transparency Requirements Validator
**Task**: Validate transparency-requirements-user.md against current user visibility systems. Analyze transparency protocols. Audit sub-agent reporting mechanisms. Check parallel execution transparency. Generate enhancement recommendations.

## Agent 5: Content Auditing & Documentation-First Validator
**Task**: Combined analysis of content-auditing-methodology-user.md and documentation-first-methodology-user.md. Validate current content auditing. Assess documentation-first implementation. Provide integrated assessment.

## Agent 6: Command Review & Execution Strategies Validator
**Task**: Validate command-review-methodology-user.md and execution-strategies-user.md. Analyze current command review. Validate execution strategies. Check command governance. Generate compliance report.

## Agent 7: Consolidation Strategy & Root Directory Auditing Validator
**Task**: Analyze consolidation-strategy-user.md and root-directory-auditing-methodology-user.md. Validate consolidation approach. Check root directory auditing. Assess modular architecture implementation.

## Agent 8: Coherence Validation Methodology Validator
**Task**: Analyze coherence-validation-methodology-user.md. Validate current coherence systems. Check coherence protocols. Assess system coherence. Generate coherence assessment with improvement plan.

## Agent 9: PTS Framework & Standards Integration Validator
**Task**: Cross-validate PTS Framework integration across technical requirements. Analyze PTS Framework. Check PTS application and governance. Assess PTS integration in technical requirements files.

## Agent 10: Implementation Gap Analysis & Priority Matrix Generator
**Task**: Comprehensive gap analysis and priority matrix generation. Synthesize findings from Sub-Agents 1-9. Create master gap identification matrix. Generate priority classification system. Create implementation timeline.

## Expected Deliverables
### Individual Agent Reports (1-10)
Each sub-agent MUST report individually: specific technical requirement compliance status, implementation gaps identified, current system strengths, priority recommendations, cross-validation results.

### Consolidated Analysis
- Master compliance matrix across all 11 technical requirements files
- Priority-ranked gap identification  
- Implementation roadmap with phases
- Resource allocation recommendations
- Risk assessment for non-compliance areas

### Strategic Recommendations
- Critical path for technical requirements implementation
- Quick wins vs long-term strategic improvements
- Resource optimization strategies
- Quality gate integration points

## Success Criteria
✅ **Complete Coverage**: All 11 technical requirements files analyzed  
✅ **Individual Visibility**: Each sub-agent reports findings individually  
✅ **Gap Identification**: Comprehensive gap matrix generated  
✅ **Priority Classification**: Clear implementation priorities established  
✅ **Cross-Validation**: Requirements validated against current implementation  
✅ **Actionable Roadmap**: Specific implementation steps with timelines

## Integration Points
**Authority Validation**: Cross-reference with user-input/README.md Sacred User Space principles  
**Technical Integration**: Validate against docs/core/ consolidated authority  
**Command Integration**: Check export/commands/ library compliance  
**Standards Integration**: Validate against rules/ system protocols  
**Quality Integration**: Cross-check with docs/core/05-per-performance/ frameworks
