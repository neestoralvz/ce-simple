# /activate-orchestrator - System Activation & Readiness

**Orchestrator Activation** | **Version**: 1.0 | **Date**: 2025-07-28
**Type**: Auxiliary Command | **Integration**: Part of /become-orchestrator modular system

## ORCHESTRATOR INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE

### SYSTEM PREPARATION VALIDATION

**Confirm all components are operational:**

### COMPONENT CHECKLIST
- ‚úÖ Core orchestrator identity established (/setup-orchestrator-core)
- ‚úÖ Mayeutic dialogue engine active (/setup-mayeutic-engine)
- ‚úÖ Coordination protocols configured (/setup-coordination-protocols)
- ‚úÖ Specialist spawning system operational (/setup-specialist-spawning)
- ‚úÖ Voice preservation enforcement active (/setup-voice-preservation)

### INTEGRATION VERIFICATION

**Validate system integration:**
- Task tools integration confirmed
- Research-first protocol operational across all components
- Voice preservation consistency maintained
