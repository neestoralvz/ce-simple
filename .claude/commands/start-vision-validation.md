# Vision Validation Orchestrator

**Command**: `/start-vision-validation`  
**Purpose**: Deploy 8 parallel sub-agents to analyze user vision files for consistency, completeness, and implementation alignment  
**Authority**: user-input/vision/ (Sacred User Space)

## Agent 1: Core Mission Analysis
**Task**: Analyze user-input/vision/core-mission-concept.md for mission clarity, differentiator feasibility, system purpose alignment, philosophy consistency, and success metrics measurability. Report findings with technical assessment.

## Agent 2: Command Philosophy Validation  
**Task**: Analyze user-input/vision/command-philosophy-user.md for command design soundness, self-containment feasibility, UI balance, orchestration clarity, and learning integration. Report alignment with core mission.

## Agent 3: Development Methodology Assessment
**Task**: Analyze user-input/vision/development-methodology-user.md for workflow applicability, vision-driven strategy, learning mechanisms, quality framework, and evolution foundation. Report methodology viability.

## Agent 4: Autonomous Systems Evaluation
**Task**: Analyze user-input/vision/autonomous-systems-user.md for autonomy achievability, oversight requirements, decision framework, error recovery, and learning evolution. Report technical feasibility.

## Agent 5: Global System Architecture
**Task**: Analyze user-input/vision/global-system-user.md for integration architecture, scalability design, interconnection protocols, optimization strategies, and coordination mechanisms. Report architectural soundness.

## Agent 6: Application Evolution Framework
**Task**: Analyze user-input/vision/application-evolution-user.md for evolution implementation, adaptation automation, feedback integration, improvement protocols, and development methodology. Report framework completeness.

## Agent 7: Communication Documentation Strategy
**Task**: Analyze user-input/vision/communication-documentation-user.md for strategy clarity, protocol effectiveness, reporting design, transparency delivery, and automation possibilities. Report framework viability.

## Agent 8: Vision Integration Synthesis
**Task**: Cross-analyze all user-input/vision/ files for internal consistency, technical integration, implementation priorities, conflict resolution, and coverage gaps. Report integration assessment and roadmap.

## Individual Agent Reporting Protocol
**Requirement**: Each agent MUST report individual findings before synthesis
**Format**: Direct agent output → user visibility → integration analysis
**Quality Gate**: No synthesis until all 8 agents report complete analysis

## Integration Synthesis Protocol
### Phase 1: Individual Analysis Collection
- Collect all 8 agent reports
- Verify completeness of analysis coverage
- Identify critical findings and recommendations

### Phase 2: Cross-Agent Pattern Analysis  
- Identify consistency patterns across agents
- Flag conflicting requirements or assessments
- Synthesize technical feasibility consensus

### Phase 3: Implementation Roadmap Generation
- Priority ranking of vision elements
- Technical complexity assessment
- Resource requirement estimation
- Development timeline projection

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Individual Agent Reports**: 8 detailed vision file analyses
2. **Consistency Matrix**: Cross-vision alignment assessment
3. **Technical Feasibility Report**: Implementation viability analysis  
4. **Priority Implementation Roadmap**: Development sequence recommendation
5. **Gap Analysis**: Missing vision elements identification
6. **Risk Assessment**: Technical and strategic risk identification

## Success Metrics
- **Coverage**: 100% of vision files analyzed
- **Depth**: Technical feasibility assessed for all major components
- **Integration**: Cross-vision consistency validated
- **Actionability**: Clear implementation priorities identified
- **Transparency**: Individual agent work visible to user
