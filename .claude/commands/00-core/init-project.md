# init-project

## Purpose

Executes complete ce-simple project initialization through automated git setup providing functional development foundation with intelligent command orchestration.

## Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Focus on project initialization without ongoing development
- **Granular Approach**: Break setup into parallel creation units with clear validation
- **Resource Management**: Handle git integration with explicit permission requirements
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in rollback capabilities and partial creation handling

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Environment Setup
Mark "Environment Setup and Git Initialization" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute git initialization:
- Initialize git repository with configuration and branch setup
- Configure basic project settings including author information
- Validate directory permissions and file system access
- Prepare environment variables and system dependencies

Use Bash to initialize git:
- Git initialization achieving repository setup
- Configuration setup with permission validation

If git initialization failures occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve git error: permission verification"
- Execute retry with permission verification and access checks
- Validate git readiness ensuring repository functionality
- Continue with validated git configuration

Complete previous phase, mark "Structure Creation and Template Deployment" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 2: Structure Creation
Mark "Structure Creation and Template Deployment" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute directory creation:
- Create complete directory hierarchy following ce-simple standards
- Deploy template-based structure with category organization
- Generate core system files including configuration components
- Establish file structure foundation ready for documentation

Use Bash to create directories:
- Directory creation achieving hierarchy establishment
- Template deployment with structure validation

If structure creation issues occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve structure error: rollback and restart"
- Execute rollback of partial creation with validated permissions
- Validate structure completeness ensuring foundation integrity
- Continue with validated directory structure

Complete previous phase, mark "Documentation Generation and Cross-Reference Setup" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 3: Documentation Generation
Mark "Documentation Generation and Cross-Reference Setup" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute documentation creation:
- Generate comprehensive CLAUDE.md with system overview
- Create README.md with project introduction and navigation
- Establish cross-reference validation system ensuring consistency
- Generate essential documentation templates and standards

Use Write to create documentation:
- Documentation generation achieving system overview
- Template creation with cross-reference validation

If documentation generation errors occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve documentation error: minimal creation"
- Execute minimal docs creation with manual completion prompts
- Validate documentation completeness ensuring navigation capability
- Continue with validated documentation structure

Complete previous phase, mark "Validation and Initial Commit" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 4: Validation and Commit
Mark "Validation and Initial Commit" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute structure validation:
- Validate complete structure integrity ensuring proper configuration
- Verify standards compliance across generated files
- Create initial commit with proper attribution establishing baseline
- Generate validation report confirming system readiness

Use Bash to commit changes:
- Structure validation achieving integrity confirmation
- Standards checking with compliance verification

If validation failures occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve validation error: specific corrections"
- Execute specific corrections with guidance and retry options
- Validate correction completeness ensuring standards compliance
- Complete initialization with validated project foundation

Complete all tasks using TodoWrite

**Project initialization executes complete foundation establishment with orchestration capabilities.**
