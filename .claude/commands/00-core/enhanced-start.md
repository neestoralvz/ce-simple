# enhanced-start

## Purpose

Executes advanced discovery workflow through Phase 0 assessment providing comprehensive investigation with intelligent complexity-based routing and autotrigger execution.

## Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Focus on advanced discovery without basic discovery execution
- **Granular Approach**: Break Phase 0 validation into conditional deployment with clear thresholds
- **Resource Management**: Handle agent coordination with explicit monitoring requirements
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in restart protocols and preserved intermediate results

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Structure Validation
Mark "Structure Validation and Complexity Assessment" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute system validation:
- Validate complete system structure across ce-simple domains
- Calculate complexity scores using scope and interdependency analysis
- Assess learning requirements determining deployment thresholds
- Prepare conditional deployment matrix based on complexity parameters

Use LS to validate structure:
- Directory traversal achieving system validation
- Structure validation with component verification

If structure validation failures occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve structure error: integrity reconstruction"
- Execute incremental directory checks with reconstruction
- Validate structure completeness ensuring system integrity
- Continue with validated structure parameters

Complete previous phase, mark "Agent Deployment and Coordination Setup" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 2: Agent Deployment
Mark "Agent Deployment and Coordination Setup" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute agent initialization:
- Deploy Task Tool agents based on complexity thresholds
- Configure agent coordination parameters establishing monitoring capabilities
- Initialize discovery scope allocation assigning domains to agents
- Establish communication channels and result aggregation pathways

Use TodoWrite to deploy agents:
- Task Tool deployment achieving parallel initialization
- Agent configuration with monitoring setup

If agent deployment issues occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve deployment error: sequential fallback"
- Execute fallback to sequential deployment with enhanced monitoring
- Validate agent readiness ensuring coordination capability
- Continue with deployed agent configuration

Complete previous phase, mark "Discovery Coordination and Execution" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 3: Discovery Coordination
Mark "Discovery Coordination and Execution" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute parallel monitoring:
- Monitor parallel Task Tool agents with status tracking
- Coordinate execution across discovery domains ensuring coverage
- Capture intermediate results maintaining execution state
- Manage resource allocation and load balancing across agents

Use Bash to monitor agents:
- Agent monitoring achieving status tracking
- Execution coordination with coverage validation

If coordination problems occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve coordination error: agent restart"
- Execute agent restart with preserved intermediate results
- Validate coordination restoration ensuring execution continuity
- Continue with coordinated agent execution

Complete previous phase, mark "Result Aggregation and Validation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 4: Result Aggregation
Mark "Result Aggregation and Validation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute synthesis processing:
- Synthesize findings from discovery agents into investigation summary
- Validate coverage completeness ensuring scope coverage across domains
- Extract patterns and generate insights from aggregated results
- Produce final validation report with deployment decisions

Use Read to synthesize results:
- Result synthesis achieving investigation summary
- Coverage analysis with pattern extraction

If coverage gaps occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve coverage gap: targeted re-deployment"
- Execute re-deployment of targeted agents with refined scope
- Validate coverage restoration ensuring comprehensive investigation
- Complete aggregation with validated coverage parameters

Complete all tasks using TodoWrite
