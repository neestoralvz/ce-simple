# context-engine

## Purpose

Executes automated context synchronization through distributed memory management providing system coherence with validated cross-referencing performance.

## Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Focus on distributed memory synchronization without agent coordination
- **Granular Approach**: Break file changes into monitored units with clear validation
- **Resource Management**: Handle context dependencies with explicit rollback requirements
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in atomic operations and integrity reconstruction protocols

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Context Detection
Mark "Context Detection and Analysis" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute change monitoring:
- Monitor file system changes across ce-simple domains
- Detect context update requirements through git integration
- Map cross-reference dependencies and cascade requirements
- Calculate synchronization scope and prioritize updates

Use Git to track changes:
- File monitoring achieving change detection
- Timestamp analysis ensuring update requirements

If detection failures occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve detection error: scope validation"
- Execute incremental scope reduction with manual fallback
- Validate detection completeness ensuring system integrity
- Continue with validated scope parameters

Complete previous phase, mark "Update Engine Execution" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 2: Update Engine
Mark "Update Engine Execution" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute batch processing:
- Execute context updates through intelligent batching
- Resolve update conflicts using automated merge algorithms
- Apply changes with atomic operations ensuring rollback
- Validate update consistency maintaining system coherence

Use Edit to apply changes:
- Batch processing achieving parallel optimization
- Conflict resolution with integrity preservation

If update conflicts occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve conflict: automated merge failure"
- Execute automatic resolution with human review queue
- Validate conflict resolution ensuring data integrity
- Continue with resolved updates

Complete previous phase, mark "Synchronization Validation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 3: Synchronization Validation
Mark "Synchronization Validation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute integrity verification:
- Verify context integrity across all memory domains
- Confirm cross-reference accuracy eliminating broken links
- Measure synchronization performance generating optimization recommendations
- Consolidate results into comprehensive validation report

Use Grep to validate references:
- Integrity checking achieving domain validation
- Link validation with accuracy confirmation

If validation errors occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve validation error: integrity reconstruction"
- Execute quarantine of invalid updates with reconstruction
- Validate integrity restoration ensuring system coherence
- Continue with validated context state

Complete previous phase, mark "System Coherence Confirmation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 4: System Coherence
Mark "System Coherence Confirmation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute coherence confirmation:
- Confirm distributed memory architecture coherence across components
- Apply performance optimizations based on synchronization metrics
- Update system health indicators maintaining continuous monitoring
- Finalize synchronization cycle with complete audit trail

Use Bash to monitor system:
- System monitoring achieving coherence validation
- Performance optimization with usage patterns

If performance degradation occurs:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve performance: dynamic throttling"
- Execute dynamic throttling with priority-based scheduling
- Validate performance restoration ensuring optimal operation
- Complete synchronization with optimized parameters

Complete all tasks using TodoWrite
