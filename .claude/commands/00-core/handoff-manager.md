# handoff-manager

## Purpose

Executes seamless transitions between agents and sessions through intelligent state transfer providing zero-loss handoffs with system coherence maintenance.

## Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Focus on transition management without workflow execution
- **Granular Approach**: Break state capture into preservation units with clear checkpoints
- **Resource Management**: Handle handoff protocols with explicit validation requirements
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in emergency protocols and state reconstruction verification

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: State Capture
Mark "State Capture and Packaging" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute context packaging:
- Package current context including active tasks and results
- Capture system state across relevant domains and sessions
- Prepare transition metadata with timestamps and continuation points
- Validate state completeness ensuring zero information loss

Use Read to capture context:
- Context capture achieving state packaging
- State serialization with metadata generation

If state capture failures occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve capture error: incremental packaging"
- Execute incremental context packaging with manual validation
- Validate capture completeness ensuring system integrity
- Continue with validated state package

Complete previous phase, mark "Transition Validation and Recipient Confirmation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 2: Transition Validation
Mark "Transition Validation and Recipient Confirmation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute protocol validation:
- Validate handoff protocols confirming sender recipient compatibility
- Verify recipient readiness including resource availability confirmation
- Check transition prerequisites resolving blocking conditions
- Authorize handoff execution based on validation results

Use Bash to validate readiness:
- Protocol validation achieving compatibility confirmation
- Readiness checks with capability verification

If validation errors occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve validation error: handoff abort"
- Execute handoff abort with current state preservation
- Validate preservation completeness ensuring recovery capability
- Continue with validated handoff parameters

Complete previous phase, mark "Handoff Execution and State Transfer" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 3: Handoff Execution
Mark "Handoff Execution and State Transfer" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute state transfer:
- Execute state transfer with integrity checking capabilities
- Transfer packaged context to recipient with verification protocols
- Monitor transfer progress handling interruptions and corruption
- Confirm successful state reception validating transfer completeness

Use Write to transfer state:
- State transfer achieving integrity monitoring
- Progress monitoring with reception confirmation

If execution issues occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve execution error: automatic rollback"
- Execute automatic rollback to previous stable state
- Validate rollback completeness ensuring system integrity
- Continue with rollback to stable configuration

Complete previous phase, mark "Continuity Verification and System Coherence" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 4: Continuity Verification
Mark "Continuity Verification and System Coherence" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute continuity confirmation:
- Verify successful transition completion confirming operational continuity
- Validate system coherence across affected components resolving inconsistencies
- Generate comprehensive handoff report with validation results
- Establish post-handoff monitoring ensuring sustained effectiveness

Use Grep to verify continuity:
- Continuity verification achieving transition confirmation
- Coherence validation with inconsistency resolution

If continuity breaks occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve continuity break: emergency reconstruction"
- Execute emergency state reconstruction with integrity verification
- Validate reconstruction completeness ensuring operational continuity
- Complete handoff with verified continuity restoration

Complete all tasks using TodoWrite
