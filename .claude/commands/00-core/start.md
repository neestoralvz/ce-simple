## Purpose

Executes intelligent discovery workflow through mathematical assessment providing actionable execution plans with optimized performance targeting and accuracy validation.

## Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Focus on discovery workflow without execution operations
- **Granular Approach**: Break mathematical scoring into precision units with clear validation
- **Resource Management**: Handle parallel deployment with explicit threshold requirements
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in simplified metrics fallback and conservative deployment

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Mathematical Assessment
Mark "Mathematical Assessment and Complexity Analysis" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute complexity calculation:
- Calculate complexity scores using mathematical algorithms and scope analysis
- Determine confidence levels through statistical validation metrics
- Perform mathematical assessment validation ensuring accuracy thresholds
- Generate assessment metadata including complexity factors and indicators

Use Bash to calculate metrics:
- Mathematical algorithms achieving complexity scoring
- Statistical analysis with confidence metrics

If assessment calculation failures occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve calculation error: simplified metrics"
- Execute retry with simplified metrics and manual validation
- Validate calculation completeness ensuring assessment accuracy
- Continue with validated assessment parameters

Complete previous phase, mark "Deployment Decision and Auto-Trigger Logic" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 2: Deployment Decision
Mark "Deployment Decision and Auto-Trigger Logic" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute auto-trigger logic:
- Execute auto-trigger logic based on complexity threshold analysis
- Validate deployment decision criteria using statistical confidence
- Prepare agent deployment parameters based on threshold analysis
- Configure deployment mode selection ensuring optimal allocation

Use TodoWrite to configure deployment:
- Threshold analysis achieving decision validation
- Decision algorithms with deployment configuration

If threshold decision errors occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve threshold error: conservative deployment"
- Execute default to conservative deployment with manual review
- Validate deployment readiness ensuring resource availability
- Continue with validated deployment configuration

Complete previous phase, mark "Workflow Execution and Agent Deployment" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 3: Workflow Execution
Mark "Workflow Execution and Agent Deployment" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute agent deployment:
- Deploy agents based on validated decision criteria
- Coordinate parallel task execution ensuring optimal utilization
- Monitor agent deployment progress with status tracking
- Manage workflow execution state ensuring continuity capabilities

Use TodoWrite to deploy agents:
- Agent deployment achieving parallel initialization
- Parallel coordination with execution monitoring

If agent deployment issues occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve deployment error: sequential fallback"
- Execute sequential deployment with enhanced monitoring
- Validate deployment restoration ensuring agent functionality
- Continue with validated deployment state

Complete previous phase, mark "Validation Monitoring and Performance Optimization" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 4: Validation Monitoring
Mark "Validation Monitoring and Performance Optimization" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute performance monitoring:
- Monitor performance metrics ensuring completion confidence targets
- Validate execution results against mathematical assessment predictions
- Generate performance analytics with target validation recommendations
- Capture learning patterns for continuous improvement optimization

Use Bash to monitor performance:
- Performance monitoring achieving validation targets
- Validation systems with analytics generation

If validation failures occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve validation error: learning capture"
- Execute learning capture activation with pattern documentation
- Validate learning completeness ensuring improvement capability
- Complete workflow with validated performance metrics

Complete all tasks using TodoWrite
