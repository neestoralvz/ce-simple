# 00-core - Core System Commands

## Purpose
Fundamental system operations that form the foundation of ce-simple. These commands handle primary entry points, system initialization, and essential orchestration functions.

## Commands
- `/start` - Primary discovery engine with mathematical decision framework and auto-triggering
- `/enhanced-start` - Advanced discovery with structural validation and conditional agent deployment
- `/init-project` - Complete project initialization with git, structure, and core documentation
- `/context-engine` - Automated context updating and synchronization across distributed memory architecture
- `/notify-manager` - Centralized notification management for transparent delegation and state tracking
- `/handoff-manager` - Seamless agent and session transitions with complete state preservation
- `/todowrite-system` - Task orchestration system for parallel execution and workflow coordination

## Category Relations
- **Triggers**: 01-discovery, 02-planning, 03-analysis
- **Coordinates**: All categories through orchestration
- **Depends on**: 10-standards for compliance validation
- **Monitors**: 08-learning for continuous improvement

## Usage Patterns
```
/start → Mathematical assessment → Auto-triggering → Task orchestration
/enhanced-start → Structural validation → Agent deployment → Discovery coordination  
/init-project → Environment setup → Foundation establishment
/context-engine → Context sync → Memory architecture maintenance
/notify-manager → Delegation tracking → Transparent state updates
/handoff-manager → Session transitions → State preservation
/todowrite-system → Task coordination → Parallel execution
```

## Orchestration Model
Core commands use intelligent task coordination:
- Parallel execution when possible
- Sequential for dependent operations
- Dynamic questioning throughout all phases
- Automatic fallback and recovery mechanisms

## Integration Points
- Entry point for all user interactions
- Central coordination hub for complex workflows
- System integrity validation checkpoint
- Performance and health monitoring center
