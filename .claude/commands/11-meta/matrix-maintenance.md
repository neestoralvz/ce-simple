# Matrix Maintenance - Maintenance Command

## Purpose
Comprehensive maintenance of cross-reference matrix for systematic dependency tracking, structural integrity validation, and proactive failure prevention across the system.

## Principles and Guidelines

**Single Responsibility**: Focus exclusively on cross-reference matrix maintenance without implementation or coordination
**Granular Maintenance**: Break matrix operations into small, specific maintenance steps
**Integrity Management**: Clear validation protocols with explicit structural requirements
**Error Recovery**: Built-in maintenance failure handling and matrix correction protocols

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Component Discovery and Inventory
Update TodoWrite: Mark "Component discovery and inventory" as in_progress

Execute comprehensive component discovery:
- Use Glob tool to discover all markdown files across system
- Use Glob to identify configuration files and system components
- Use Glob to map command system files and documentation
- Inventory all system components requiring cross-reference tracking

Analyze system structure and organization:
- Map directory organization and component relationships
- Identify primary system boundaries and interfaces
- Document component types and categorization
- Prepare baseline for dependency analysis

### Phase 2: Cross-Reference Analysis and Mapping
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Cross-reference analysis" as in_progress

Execute dependency relationship analysis:
- Use Grep to identify markdown link patterns and references
- Use Grep to find command invocations and system references
- Use Grep to discover configuration dependencies and connections
- Map all cross-reference relationships across components

Analyze reference patterns and integrity:
- Validate link targets exist and are accessible
- Identify broken references and missing dependencies
- Document reference patterns and relationship types
- Assess cross-reference completeness and coverage

### Phase 3: Matrix Generation and Validation
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Matrix generation and validation" as in_progress

Generate comprehensive dependency matrix:
- Create systematic mapping of all component relationships
- Document dependency types and relationship strengths
- Generate cross-reference matrix with complete coverage
- Validate matrix accuracy and completeness

Execute structural integrity validation:
- Verify all references point to valid targets
- Check bidirectional reference consistency
- Validate component accessibility and permissions
- Identify structural integrity issues and inconsistencies

Use Write tool to document matrix results:
- Create comprehensive cross-reference matrix documentation
- Document identified dependencies and relationships
- Record structural integrity validation results
- Generate matrix maintenance summary and recommendations

### Phase 4: Failure Prevention and Reporting
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Failure prevention analysis" as in_progress

Execute failure mode analysis:
- Identify potential failure points in reference structure
- Document risk factors and vulnerability patterns
- Generate mitigation strategies for identified risks
- Plan proactive maintenance and monitoring protocols

Generate maintenance recommendations:
- Document specific actions to improve matrix integrity
- Recommend structural improvements and optimizations
- Plan ongoing maintenance schedules and validation
- Generate system health summary and metrics

If matrix issues detected:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve matrix issue: [specific problem]"
- Implement immediate corrections for critical issues
- Validate matrix corrections before completion
- Document resolution approach for future maintenance

Update TodoWrite: Complete all matrix maintenance tasks
Add follow-up: "Matrix maintenance complete with validated cross-reference integrity"
