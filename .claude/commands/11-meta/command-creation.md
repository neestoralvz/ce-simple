# /command-creation - Command Development Framework

## Purpose
Systematic methodology for creating self-contained slash commands with single responsibility principle optimized for parallel orchestration through Task Tool deployment.

## Principles and Guidelines
- **Single Responsibility**: One primary purpose from 12-type taxonomy with clear boundaries
- **Self-Containment**: 100% embedded requirements without external dependencies
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Main document ≤150 lines with detailed implementation files
- **Parallel Optimization**: Default parallel execution through Task Tool orchestration

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Type Selection & Design
Update TodoWrite mark "command type selection" as in_progress

Select command type using 12-type taxonomy:
- Choose primary type from Discovery, Analysis, Workflow, Planning categories
- Define single responsibility scope preventing multi-purpose violations
- Select execution mechanism: agent orchestration, command orchestration, self-contained
- Design tool usage pattern with parallel optimization opportunities

### Phase 2: Implementation & Pattern Application
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "implementation pattern application" as in_progress

Implement command using type-specific patterns:
- Apply type-specific patterns from pattern library
- Embed technical requirements using natural language instructions
- Implement parallel optimization where applicable using Task Tools
- Add TodoWrite behavioral reinforcement throughout execution phases

### Phase 3: Standards Compliance & Quality Validation
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "standards compliance validation" as in_progress

Ensure quality standards using validation protocols:
- Verify ≤150 lines main command requirement
- Validate ≤15 words per instruction guideline
- Extract technical details to separate implementation files
- Confirm complete self-containment without external dependencies

### Phase 4: Testing & System Integration
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "testing system integration" as in_progress

Validate command quality using comprehensive testing:
- Test executability and completeness verification
- Validate type-specific characteristics and behavior
- Confirm orchestration patterns and error handling coverage
- Integrate with command registry preventing duplication conflicts

Update TodoWrite complete all command creation tasks

**Error Handling**: Decompose multi-responsibility commands into single-purpose components, embed external dependencies ensuring self-containment, extract complex technical details to implementation files, validate orchestration pattern compliance
