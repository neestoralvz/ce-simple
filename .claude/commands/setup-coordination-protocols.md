# /setup-coordination-protocols - Multi-Specialist Management

**Coordination Protocols Setup** | **Version**: 1.0 | **Date**: 2025-07-28
**Type**: Auxiliary Command | **Integration**: Part of /become-orchestrator modular system

## COORDINATION STATE MANAGEMENT

### TASK CREATION PROTOCOL
**When spawning specialized conversations:**

### TASK DEFINITION STRUCTURE
For each specialized conversation, create clear task definition:
- **Conversation Type**: Specify specialist role (Research, Implementation, etc.)
- **Task Description**: Clear, actionable objectives
- **Priority Level**: High, Medium, or Low based on user needs
- **Context Payload**: All relevant information for the specialist
- **Research Requirements**: Mandatory WebSearch + MCP Context7 integration
- **Voice Preservation**: Enforce user voice as absolute truth source

### COORDINATION MESSAGING SYSTEM

**Maintain communication across conversations:**
- Broadcast coordination updates to all active specialists
- Track orchestrator status and availability
- Monitor active conversation health and progress
- Report research integration status across all specialists
- Ensure voice preservation consistency

### STATUS REPORTING FORMAT

**Maintain orchestrator status tracking:**

### STANDARD REPORTING TEMPLATE
Regularly update coordination state with:
- **Current timestamp** using $(date)
- **Active conversation count** and types
- **Research integration status** across all specialists
- **Voice preservation score** (target >= 54/60)
- **Mayeutic dialogue progress** and insights discovered
- **Auto-spawn trigger status** and pending activations

## INTER-SPECIALIST COORDINATION

### COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

**Cross-conversation coordination patterns:**
- Shared context maintenance across specialists
- Decision synchronization requirements
- Progress checkpoint coordination
- Quality gate validation across conversations

### DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT

**Handle specialist interdependencies:**
- Sequential task completion requirements
- Parallel processing coordination
- Resource sharing between specialists
- Conflict resolution protocols

### PROGRESS MONITORING

**Track multi-conversation progress:**
- Individual specialist status tracking
- Overall project completion metrics
- Bottleneck identification and resolution
- Quality assurance checkpoint validation

## NOTIFICATION SYSTEM SETUP

### AUTOMATIC PROGRESS REPORTING

**Sistema de notificaci√≥n autom√°tica de progreso al orquestador:**

### NOTIFICATION TRIGGERS
- Specialist conversation completion
- Critical milestone achievements
- Quality gate violations
- Coordination bottleneck detection
- Research integration status changes

### NOTIFICATION PROTOCOL
**Format for orchestrator notifications:**
```
‚è∫ [TIMESTAMP] [SPECIALIST_TYPE] [STATUS_CHANGE]
Context: [Brief description]
Impact: [Coordination implications]
Next: [Required orchestrator action]
```

### PROGRESS AGGREGATION

**Consolidate multi-specialist progress:**
- Overall completion percentage calculation
- Critical path identification
- Resource utilization tracking
- Quality metrics aggregation

## ACTIVATION CONFIRMATION

### COORDINATION READINESS CHECKLIST

**Confirm these protocols are established:**
- Task creation templates configured
- Inter-specialist communication channels ready
- Progress monitoring systems active
- Notification protocols established
- Status reporting formats defined
