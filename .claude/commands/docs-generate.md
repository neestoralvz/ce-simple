# Docs Generate - Todo Plans to Documentation Creation

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Convert todo list plans into structured Markdown documentation through parallel agent deployment and 3-wave execution strategy.

## ðŸš€ Usage
Execute: `/docs-generate [scope]`

## ðŸ”§ Implementation

### Behavioral Reinforcement Protocol
**MANDATORY at generation initialization**:

```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "ðŸ“‹ ANALYSIS: Analyze todo plans and validate documentation requirements", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "generate-analysis-1"},
  {"content": "ðŸš€ WAVE1: Execute parallel agent deployment for document creation", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "generate-wave1-1"},
  {"content": "ðŸ”— WAVE2: Build comprehensive cross-reference integration network", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "generate-wave2-1"},
  {"content": "âœ… WAVE3: Execute quality validation with comprehensive audit", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "generate-wave3-1"},
  {"content": "ðŸ”„ RECOVERY: Monitor and execute error recovery with targeted corrections", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "generate-recovery-1"}
])
```

**Wave-Progressive Todos**: Add stage-specific todos as each wave completes with quality gate validation

### Execution Framework
**3-Wave Strategy**: Parallel creation â†’ Cross-reference integration â†’ Quality validation

**Core Protocol**:
1. **WAVE 1**: Deploy specialized agents per document (parallel execution)
2. **WAVE 2**: Build bidirectional cross-reference network
3. **WAVE 3**: Execute comprehensive quality validation with `/docs-audit`

**Progress Tracking**: Real-time notifications with agent status, completion metrics, and quality gates

**Error Recovery**: Automatic failure detection with targeted correction agents and retry logic

## âš¡ Triggers

### Input Triggers
**Context**: Todo lists containing documentation creation plans
**Previous**: `/start` â†’ documentation workflow detection â†’ `/docs-generate`
**Keywords**: generate, create, documentation, todo, plans

### Output Triggers
**When**: Generation complete â†’ `/docs-audit` for quality validation
**When**: Quality issues â†’ Recursive correction with targeted agents
**When**: Success achieved â†’ Documentation ready for integration
**Chain**: generate â†’ validate â†’ (correct if needed) â†’ complete

### Success Patterns
**Generation Success**: All documents created with template compliance
**Integration Success**: Cross-reference network established with >99% accuracy
**Quality Success**: Combined score â‰¥85% with no critical failures
