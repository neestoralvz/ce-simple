# Docs Generate - Todo Plans to Documentation Creation

## 🎯 Purpose
Convert todo list plans into structured Markdown documentation through parallel agent deployment and 3-wave execution strategy.

## 🚀 Usage
Execute: `/docs-generate [scope]`

## 🔧 Implementation

### 3-Wave Execution Strategy
1. **WAVE 1**: Parallel document creation (one agent per document)
2. **WAVE 2**: Cross-reference integration (bidirectional linking)
3. **WAVE 3**: Quality validation (standards compliance + metrics)

### Execution Protocol

#### Wave 1: Parallel Document Creation
**AGENT DEPLOYMENT**:
- Parse todo plans → Identify document requirements
- Deploy specialized agents per document (parallel execution)
- Apply template standards during creation
- Validate basic structure compliance

**Progress Tracking**:
```
📝 WAVE-1: Deploying [N] document agents → Parallel creation initiated
📄 PROGRESS: Document [X]/[N] completed → Template compliance verified
🔧 AGENT-[ID]: [Document] created → [Lines] lines, structure validated
```

#### Wave 2: Cross-Reference Integration
**REFERENCE BUILDING**:
- Analyze document relationships → Identify connection points
- Generate bidirectional cross-reference network
- Apply standard "See Also" format
- Validate reference completeness

**Integration Logic**:
```
🔗 WAVE-2: Cross-reference analysis → [N] connection points identified
📊 LINKING: [X] references created → Bidirectional network established
✅ VALIDATION: [Y]% reference coverage → Navigation depth verified
```

#### Wave 3: Quality Validation
**VALIDATION SEQUENCE**:
- Execute structural compliance checks
- Apply quantitative metrics assessment
- Trigger `/docs-audit` for comprehensive analysis
- Generate quality report with actionable recommendations

**Quality Gates**:
```
✅ WAVE-3: Quality validation initiated → Multi-layer assessment
📊 METRICS: [Structure/Content/References] → Combined score calculation
🔍 AUDIT: Comprehensive analysis → Health score: [X]/100
```

### Error Handling and Recovery

#### Validation Failure Protocol
**FAILURE DETECTION**:
- Quality score < 85% threshold
- Critical structural violations
- Reference integrity issues
- Template non-compliance

**RECOVERY ACTIONS**:
```
⚠️ ISSUES: Quality threshold not met → Score: [X]% (target: 85%)
🔄 CORRECTION: Deploying targeted agents → Focus: [specific issues]
🎯 RETRY: Corrective actions completed → Re-validation triggered
```

#### Git Integration Protocol
**SESSION-COMPLETION Tracking**: Automatic commit generation on successful 3-wave completion

**Success Commit Structure**:
```bash
git add . && git commit -m "docs-generate: 3-wave creation completed

### Integration Points

#### Todo List Processing
**PLAN EXTRACTION**:
- Scan current todo lists for documentation plans
- Parse document requirements and specifications
- Validate plan completeness before execution
- Generate execution roadmap with agent allocation

#### Standards Compliance
**TEMPLATE APPLICATION**:
- Apply command template structure to generated documents
- Enforce writing standards (≤200 lines, density optimization)
- Implement anti-bias protocols (evidence-based content)
- Validate cross-reference integration patterns

## ⚡ Triggers

### Input Triggers
**Context**: Todo lists containing documentation creation plans
**Previous**: `/start` → documentation workflow detection → `/docs-generate`
**Keywords**: generate, create, documentation, todo, plans

### Output Triggers
**When**: Generation complete → `/docs-audit` for quality validation
**When**: Quality issues → Recursive correction with targeted agents
**When**: Success achieved → Documentation ready for integration
**Chain**: generate → validate → (correct if needed) → complete

### Success Patterns
**Generation Success**: All documents created with template compliance
**Integration Success**: Cross-reference network established with >99% accuracy
**Quality Success**: Combined score ≥85% with no critical failures
