## 🔧 Implementation

### Behavioral Reinforcement Protocol
**MANDATORY at matrix maintenance initialization**:

```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "🔍 SCAN: Execute comprehensive dependency discovery across all components", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "matrix-scan-1"},
  {"content": "📊 MATRIX: Generate/update cross-reference matrix with FMEA integration", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "matrix-update-1"},
  {"content": "⚠️ VALIDATE: Verify structural integrity and dependency completeness", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "matrix-validate-1"},
  {"content": "🛡️ PREVENT: Identify potential failure modes and mitigation strategies", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "matrix-prevent-1"},
