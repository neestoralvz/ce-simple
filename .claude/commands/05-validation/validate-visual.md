# Validate Visual - Validation Command

## Purpose
Executes comprehensive visual and UX validation for usability, aesthetics, accessibility, and responsive design through multi-device testing and user experience assessment across various platforms.

## Principles and Guidelines

- **Single Responsibility**: Focus exclusively on visual and UX validation without handling technical or creative assessment tasks
- **Granular Validation**: Break visual validation into small, manageable assessment phases with clear UX metrics
- **UX Management**: Clear validation dependencies with explicit accessibility standards and responsive design checkpoints
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in visual validation failure handling and recovery protocols with alternative testing methods

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Visual Assessment Setup
Update TodoWrite: Mark "Visual validation setup" as in_progress

Initialize multi-device testing environment:
- Configure testing environments for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Set up accessibility scanning tools and WCAG compliance checkers
- Initialize visual regression testing and design consistency validation
- Define UX metrics and user journey evaluation criteria

Validate assessment parameters:
- Check validation scope and compliance standards
- Verify device testing requirements and configurations
- Confirm accessibility standards and threshold settings
- Validate testing tool accessibility and functionality

### Phase 2: Multi-Dimensional UX Validation
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Multi-dimensional UX validation" as in_progress

Execute usability and aesthetic validation:
- Test navigation flow and interaction patterns
- Validate visual hierarchy and color harmony
- Assess typography consistency and readability
- Evaluate user task completion effectiveness

Perform accessibility and responsive analysis:
- Execute WCAG compliance audit with automated checks
- Test screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation
- Validate cross-device compatibility and viewport responsiveness
- Assess performance across different device configurations

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Visual Testing
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Visual testing execution" as in_progress

Run parallel visual testing across devices:
- Execute desktop experience validation with full functionality
- Test tablet compatibility with touch interactions
- Validate mobile responsiveness with various screen sizes
- Perform cross-browser compatibility testing

Execute user journey simulation:
- Test end-to-end user workflows and interactions
- Validate form submissions and input handling
- Assess loading performance and visual feedback
- Generate comprehensive UX assessment with metrics

### Phase 4: Enhancement Integration and Reporting
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "Visual validation reporting" as in_progress

Compile visual validation report:
- Document usability scores and accessibility compliance
- Generate aesthetic ratings and responsive design assessment
- Create detailed improvement recommendations
- Prepare comprehensive UX certification documentation

Process visual validation results:
- Validate results against UX quality gate thresholds
- Identify critical UX issues affecting user experience
- Generate visual design compliance certification
- Document successful validations with design patterns

If visual validation failures detected:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve visual validation failure: [specific issue]"
- Implement targeted design iteration for failed UX areas
- Execute visual enhancement recommendations
- Validate design improvement effectiveness before completion

Update TodoWrite: Complete all visual validation tasks
Add follow-up: "Visual validation report ready with UX enhancement recommendations"

**Single Responsibility**: Visual validator focused exclusively on UX and accessibility assessment without technical or creative validation responsibilities.
