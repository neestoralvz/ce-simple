# Evolution Tracking Orchestrator

**Purpose**: Master coordination for VDD framework evolution compliance monitoring  
**Authority**: Orchestration layer for systematic evolution assessment  
**Command**: `/start-evolution-monitoring`  
**Parallel Agents**: 6 specialized sub-agents via Task Tool deployment

## Command: /start-evolution-monitoring

Deploy 6 parallel Task Tool agents to monitor VDD migration completion across all framework components, assess Sacred User Space integrity, track framework refinements implementation, capture evolution patterns, and validate future roadmap alignment.

## Embedded Sub-Agent Prompts for Parallel Task Tool Deployment

### Agent 1: VDD Migration Completion Assessment
**Task**: Complete migration from ce-simple to VDD architecture verification
1. Search for remaining "ce-simple" references across entire codebase using Grep tool
2. Verify CLAUDE.md reflects complete VDD reset status as specified in user-input/evolution/
3. Analyze docs/core/ structure alignment with VDD framework principles
4. Check .claude/commands/ for VDD-compliant command implementations
5. Report migration completion percentage and remaining artifacts list

### Agent 2: Framework Refinements Implementation Status
**Task**: Track implementation of specific framework refinements from evolution sessions
1. Read user-input/evolution/2025-07-25-23-39-vdd-migration-vision.md completely
2. Read user-input/evolution/2025-07-26-00-25-framework-refinements-complete.md completely
3. Map requirements to current implementation status in docs/core/
4. Verify Sacred User Space vs AI Implementation separation compliance
5. Report refinements implementation status matrix and user philosophy compliance

### Agent 3: Sacred User Space Integrity Monitor
**Task**: Verify absolute protection of user-input/ folder from AI modification
1. Analyze all files in user-input/ directory structure completely
2. Verify content shows only user voice and literal transcriptions
3. Check for any AI-generated content or structural modifications
4. Validate organic, conversational, opinion-based preservation
5. Report Sacred User Space integrity score and AI contamination incidents

### Agent 4: AI Implementation Boundaries Compliance
**Task**: Verify proper AI implementation space usage and structured derivation quality
1. Analyze docs/ directory as designated AI implementation space
2. Verify "sera por completo creacion del agente" principle compliance
3. Check structured content derivation from user-input/ sources
4. Validate best practices application in AI-generated content
5. Report AI implementation boundaries compliance and derivation quality

### Agent 5: Evolution Session Capture Protocols
**Task**: Analyze and optimize systematic capture of framework evolution patterns
1. Analyze existing user-input/evolution/ session structure and content
2. Extract patterns from user architectural decision processes
3. Identify key evolution moments and framework refinement triggers
4. Assess session capture completeness and user voice preservation
5. Report evolution session capture effectiveness and learning protocols

### Agent 6: Future Roadmap Alignment Validator
**Task**: Assess framework evolution trajectory alignment with comprehensive user vision
1. Analyze complete user-input/vision/ directory for core mission alignment
2. Review user-input/technical-requirements/ for implementation trajectory
3. Map current framework capabilities to user's long-term vision
4. Compare current docs/core/ implementation with user vision endpoints
5. Report future roadmap alignment score and strategic direction coherence

## Evolution Compliance Scoring Framework

### Primary Metrics (6 scores, 0-100% each):
1. **VDD Migration Completion**: Transition from ce-simple to VDD framework
2. **Framework Refinements Implementation**: User-specified architectural changes
3. **Sacred User Space Integrity**: Protection of user-input/ from AI modification
4. **AI Implementation Boundaries**: Proper structured derivation quality
5. **Evolution Session Capture**: Learning and pattern recognition effectiveness
6. **Future Roadmap Alignment**: Strategic direction coherence with user vision

### Expected Deliverables:
- Evolution Compliance Dashboard: Real-time scoring across all 6 metrics
- Critical Gap Identification: Priority action items for evolution completion
- User Feedback Integration: Systematic capture improvement recommendations
- Strategic Alignment Report: Long-term vision implementation trajectory
