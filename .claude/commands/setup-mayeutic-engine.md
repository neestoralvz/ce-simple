# /setup-mayeutic-engine - Discovery Dialogue System

**Mayeutic Engine Setup** | **Version**: 1.0 | **Date**: 2025-07-28
**Type**: Auxiliary Command | **Integration**: Part of /become-orchestrator modular system

## MAYEUTIC DIALOGUE ENGINE ACTIVATION

### DISCOVERY CONVERSATION PATTERNS

Use guided questioning to understand user needs and identify required specializations.

### CONTEXT DISCOVERY QUESTIONS
**Use these to understand the challenge:**
- "What specific domain expertise would be most valuable for this challenge?"
- "Which aspects of this problem require specialized knowledge?"
- "What coordination challenges do you anticipate?"
- "How would you prioritize the different components of this task?"

### SPECIALIZATION DETECTION QUESTIONS  
**Use these to identify parallel opportunities:**
- "Which parts would benefit from dedicated architectural validation?"
- "What research-intensive tasks can be isolated into specialized threads?"
- "Where do you see opportunities for parallel processing?"
- "Which aspects need continuous monitoring vs. one-time execution?"

### COORDINATION PLANNING QUESTIONS
**Use these to establish workflow:**
- "How should these specialized conversations communicate?"
- "What shared context needs to be maintained across conversations?"
- "Which decisions require cross-conversation consensus?"
- "What are the critical coordination checkpoints?"

## INTENT DETECTION SYSTEM

### AUTO-SPAWN TRIGGERS
**Automatically spawn when you detect these phrases:**
- "anÃ¡lisis especializado" â†’ Research Specialist conversation
- "validaciÃ³n arquitectÃ³nica" â†’ Architecture Validator conversation  
- "coordinaciÃ³n compleja" â†’ Integration Specialist conversation
- "seguimiento continuo" â†’ Performance Monitor conversation
- "implementaciÃ³n tÃ©cnica" â†’ Implementation Specialist conversation
- "documentaciÃ³n experta" â†’ Content Specialist conversation
- "diagnÃ³stico de problemas" â†’ Diagnostic Specialist conversation
- "optimizaciÃ³n de rendimiento" â†’ Performance Optimizer conversation

### DISCOVERY PATTERN RECOGNITION
**Context patterns that trigger specialized conversations:**
- Complex technical requirements â†’ Implementation + Architecture specialists
- Multi-domain challenges â†’ Research + Integration specialists
- Performance concerns â†’ Optimization + Monitoring specialists
- Documentation needs â†’ Content + Quality Assurance specialists

## DIALOGUE FLOW MANAGEMENT

### CONVERSATION INITIATION PATTERNS

**Start with open discovery:**
1. Acknowledge user request broadly
2. Ask context discovery questions
3. Listen for specialization indicators
4. Detect coordination requirements
5. Plan specialist spawn sequence

### PROGRESSIVE REFINEMENT

**Iterative understanding development:**
- Begin with general understanding questions
- Narrow to specific domain requirements
- Identify interdependencies between aspects
- Map parallel processing opportunities
- Establish specialist coordination needs
