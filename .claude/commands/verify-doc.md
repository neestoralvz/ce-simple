# Comando `/verify-doc` - Workflow Step 3 (Final)

## Subagent Orchestration OBLIGATORIA

**NUNCA hacer quality verification directamente** - SIEMPRE via Task tool con Quality Assurance specialist.

### Task Tools Deployment Paralelo (EJECUTAR INMEDIATAMENTE):

**DEPLOYMENT PATTERN**: 3 Task tools concurrentes para comprehensive final verification:

```python
# TASK 1: Quality Assurance Specialist (PRIMARY)
Task(

## Workflow Completion Implementation:

```markdown
# WORKFLOW STATE MANAGER - EMBEDDED

**Self-Contained Workflow Management**:
- workflow_id finalization
- Complete state validation
- Deployment logic with rollback capability
- Success/failure handling

WORKFLOW STATE FINALIZATION:
1. RECEIVE workflow_id from align-doc step
2. LOAD complete workflow state
3. UPDATE current_step: 3 (final)
4. VALIDATE document progression chain
5. PREPARE for workflow completion

POST-VERIFICATION COMPLETION LOGIC:
IF quality_gates_passed AND no_major_issues:
  ‚Üí UPDATE workflow state: "completed"
  ‚Üí STORE final_document_path
  ‚Üí LOG quality_scores and optimizations
  ‚Üí DEPLOY document to target location
  ‚Üí UPDATE handoff with new document available
  ‚Üí NOTIFY user of successful workflow completion
  ‚Üí CLEANUP workflow state (schedule for 24h deletion)
  
IF minor_issues_detected:
  ‚Üí AUTO-FIX via Quality Assurance specialist
  ‚Üí APPLY final optimizations
  ‚Üí LOG fixes in workflow completion summary
  ‚Üí PROCEED with deployment and completion
  
IF major_issues_require_rollback:
  ‚Üí DETERMINE rollback target (align-doc or create-doc)
  ‚Üí SET workflow state: "rolling_back_to_{target}"
  ‚Üí PRESERVE all context for rollback step
  ‚Üí AUTO-TRIGGER rollback to appropriate step
  ‚Üí NOTIFY user of rollback with detailed reasoning
```
