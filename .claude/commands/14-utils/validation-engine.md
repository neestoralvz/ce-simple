# Validation Engine - Multi-Domain Validation Orchestration

## Purpose
Centralized validation orchestration system providing standardized multi-domain validation coordination, parallel validation execution, result aggregation, and comprehensive assessment reporting across all validation workflows.

## Principles and Guidelines
- **Domain Orchestration**: Coordinate validation across creative, technical, visual, and completion domains
- **Parallel Execution**: Simultaneous validation execution with cross-domain integration
- **Result Aggregation**: Unified result compilation with weighted scoring and priority ranking  
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive assessment with compliance verification and certification

## Core Validation Functions

### Multi-Domain Setup Configuration
```javascript
setup_validation_channels(domains, priorities, criteria) {
  const domain_configs = domains.map(domain => ({
    name: domain,
    priority: priorities[domain] || 1.0,
    criteria: criteria[domain] || "standard"
  }))
  
  return `Initialize parallel validation channels:
${domain_configs.map(config => 
  `- Configure ${config.name} validation track (priority: ${config.priority})`
).join('\n')}
- Set up cross-validation dependencies and priority weighting
- Define escalation protocols for validation failures  
- Prepare success criteria and quality gate thresholds`
}
```

### Parallel Validation Execution
```javascript
execute_parallel_validation(validation_configs) {
  return validation_configs.map(config => 
    `Execute ${config.domain} validation track:
- Execute \`/validate-${config.domain}\` for ${config.assessment_type}
- Monitor ${config.domain} validation progress and results
- Validate ${config.domain} output quality against standards
- Document ${config.domain} validation findings`
  ).join('\n\n')
}
```

### Cross-Domain Result Aggregation
```javascript
aggregate_validation_results(domain_results, weighting_schema) {
  return `Aggregate validation results across domains:
- Collect results from all validation tracks: ${domain_results.join(', ')}
- Apply weighted scoring based on priority settings: ${JSON.stringify(weighting_schema)}
- Identify cross-domain conflicts and integration issues
- Generate holistic system health assessment`
}
```

### Comprehensive Assessment Generation  
```javascript
generate_validation_report(aggregated_results, compliance_requirements) {
  return `Compile comprehensive validation report:
- Create integrated assessment with priority-ranked issues
- Document validation results across all domains: ${aggregated_results.domains.join(', ')}
- Generate specific improvement recommendations
- Prepare comprehensive compliance record against: ${compliance_requirements.join(', ')}`
}
```

## Error Recovery and Remediation Patterns

### Domain-Specific Error Recovery
```javascript
handle_domain_validation_failure(domain, failure_type, specific_issue) {
  return `If ${domain} validation failures occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve ${domain} validation failure: ${specific_issue}"
- Implement ${domain}-specific recovery strategies
- Re-execute failed ${domain} validation components with adjustments
- Validate recovery success across all affected ${domain} areas`
}
```

### Cross-Domain Integration Recovery
```javascript
handle_integration_validation_failure(affected_domains, integration_issue) {
  return `If cross-domain integration failures detected:
- Add TodoWrite task: "CRITICAL: Resolve integration failure across ${affected_domains.join(', ')}: ${integration_issue}"
- Halt multi-domain validation until integration resolved
- Implement emergency integration recovery protocols
- Execute comprehensive cross-domain re-validation before continuation`
}
```

## Specialized Validation Configurations

### Security-Focused Validation
```javascript
security_validation_config = {
  domains: ['code', 'infrastructure', 'data'],
  priorities: { code: 1.0, infrastructure: 0.9, data: 0.8 },
  criteria: {
    code: 'vulnerability_scanning + dependency_audit',
    infrastructure: 'access_control + network_security',
    data: 'encryption + privacy_compliance'
  }
}
```

### Performance-Focused Validation
```javascript
performance_validation_config = {
  domains: ['code', 'visual', 'infrastructure'],
  priorities: { code: 1.0, visual: 0.8, infrastructure: 0.9 },
  criteria: {
    code: 'runtime_efficiency + memory_optimization',
    visual: 'load_times + rendering_performance',
    infrastructure: 'scalability + resource_utilization'
  }
}
```

### User Experience Validation
```javascript
ux_validation_config = {
  domains: ['visual', 'creative', 'functional'],
  priorities: { visual: 1.0, creative: 0.7, functional: 0.9 },
  criteria: {
    visual: 'accessibility + usability + design_consistency',
    creative: 'engagement + content_quality',
    functional: 'user_flow + interaction_design'
  }
}
```
