# /todo-manager - TodoWrite Management System

## Purpose
Universal TodoWrite management system providing standardized patterns for phase initiation, transition, completion, error handling, and behavioral reinforcement protocols across all ce-simple commands.

## Principles and Guidelines
- **Universal Templates**: Standardized TodoWrite patterns for phase initiation, transition, completion, and error handling
- **Behavioral Reinforcement**: Consistent progress tracking with single task in_progress enforcement
- **Phase-Based Workflow**: Linear progression through defined phases with explicit completion marking
- **Error Specificity**: Detailed error task creation with problem type and context documentation

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Template Pattern Application
Update TodoWrite mark "todowrite template application" as in_progress

Apply universal TodoWrite templates using standardized patterns:
- Implement phase initiation template marking tasks as in_progress
- Apply phase transition template completing previous, starting next
- Use error handling template adding specific problem resolution tasks
- Execute completion template marking workflow tasks finished

### Phase 2: Behavioral Reinforcement Implementation
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "behavioral reinforcement" as in_progress

Implement behavioral standards using pattern enforcement:
- Enforce single task in_progress at any time
- Apply immediate completion marking after task finish
- Create specific error tasks with detailed problem context
- Generate follow-up tasks for discovered issues during execution

### Phase 3: Task Category Organization
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "task category organization" as in_progress

Organize tasks using standardized categories:
- Apply Discovery Phase task patterns for assessment and analysis
- Use Analysis Phase patterns for complexity and strategy determination
- Implement Implementation Phase patterns for execution and validation
- Apply Completion Phase patterns for consolidation and reporting

### Phase 4: Error Pattern Integration & Validation
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "error pattern validation" as in_progress

Integrate error handling using standardized error types:
- Implement standard error types with specific issue classification
- Apply error task structure with action verb, problem type, context
- Validate pattern compliance across command implementations
- Generate behavioral pattern correction through reinforcement protocols

Update TodoWrite complete all TodoWrite management tasks

**Error Handling**: Maintain task state persistence across command failures, restore progress from last valid state, create error tasks automatically on workflow interruption, correct behavioral pattern violations through reinforcement

**Single Responsibility**: TodoWrite management through universal templates, behavioral reinforcement, standardized task categories, and error pattern integration ensuring consistent progress tracking across all commands.
