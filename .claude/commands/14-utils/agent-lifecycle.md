# Agent Lifecycle - Comprehensive Agent Management System

## Purpose
Centralized agent lifecycle management providing standardized agent deployment, coordination, monitoring, and recovery protocols across all agent-based workflows with intelligent resource allocation and performance optimization.

## Principles and Guidelines
- **Lifecycle Management**: Complete agent management from configuration to retirement
- **Resource Optimization**: Intelligent agent allocation based on workload and capacity analysis
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous agent performance and status tracking with proactive intervention
- **Recovery Protocols**: Automated failure detection and recovery with graceful degradation strategies
