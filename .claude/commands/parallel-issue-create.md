# /parallel-issue-create - Parallel Issue Creation Command

**31/07/2025 CDMX** | Enhanced scope management with automatic parallel issue creation workflow

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/architecture/orchestration.md → parallel-issue-create.md implements enhanced scope management per L4-Pure Orchestration methodology

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Automatic parallel issue creation for scope expansion and discovered tasks"** - Systematic detection and creation of GitHub issues for tasks discovered during execution, maintaining focus on original objectives while capturing all discovered work.

## COMMAND EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### **Enhanced Scope Management Activation**
This command implements the enhanced scope management defined in core.md steps 18a-18f:

1. **DETECTA**: Tareas descubiertas fuera scope durante ejecución + %scope expansion
2. **EVALÚA**: Si scope expansion >20% → automatic issue creation
3. **CLASIFICA**: micro-task vs complex-task vs future-enhancement con priority assessment
4. **CREA**: gh issue create con template completo (context link, priority, labels, timeline)
5. **NOTIFICA**: "Issue #X creado para [task] - continuando con plan original"
6. **CONTINÚA**: Con tarea original sin bloqueo, issues quedan para follow-up

### **Parallel Processing Framework**
**Simultaneous Issue Detection**: Monitor multiple execution streams for scope expansion
**Batch Issue Creation**: Process multiple discovered tasks in single workflow
**Context Preservation**: Maintain conversation context links for all created issues
**Priority Assessment**: Automatic priority assignment based on impact and complexity

## ISSUE CLASSIFICATION MATRIX

### **Task Classification System**
```
CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK:
├── MICRO-TASK (Priority: Low, Timeline: <1 day)
│   ├── Documentation updates, minor fixes, simple enhancements
│   └── Can be completed in single session without dependencies
├── COMPLEX-TASK (Priority: Medium, Timeline: 1-3 days)  
│   ├── Multi-component changes, system integrations, workflow updates
│   └── Requires coordination but manageable as standard issue
└── FUTURE-ENHANCEMENT (Priority: Low-Medium, Timeline: >3 days)
    ├── Architectural changes, major features, system redesigns
    └── May require handoff creation or multi-conversation coordination
```

### **Scope Expansion Thresholds**
- **≤20% expansion**: Continue with original plan, note discoveries in TodoWrite
- **21-40% expansion**: Create issues for discovered tasks, continue with original focus
- **41-60% expansion**: Create issues + suggest plan modification to user
- **>60% expansion**: Pause execution, consult user for plan revision or task split

## EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### **Step 1: Scope Monitoring**
- Monitor TodoWrite for task additions during execution
- Calculate scope expansion percentage based on original plan
- Detect cross-domain task discoveries requiring separate attention

### **Step 2: Classification Analysis**
- Analyze discovered task complexity and timeline requirements
- Assess priority based on system impact and user workflow
- Determine if task fits micro/complex/enhancement categories

### **Step 3: Batch Issue Creation**
- Process multiple discovered tasks in single gh command batch
- Apply consistent labeling and priority assignment
- Maintain conversation context links for traceability

### **Step 4: Notification & Continuity**
- Notify user of created issues with issue numbers and brief descriptions
- Confirm continuation with original plan without disruption
- Update TodoWrite to reflect scope management actions

### **Step 5: Follow-up Tracking**
- Add created issues to systematic tracking (ROADMAP_REGISTRY.md)
- Maintain issue-to-conversation mapping for future reference
- Enable parallel issue execution in future conversations

## INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING WORKFLOW

### **Core.md Integration Points**
- **Step 18a-18f**: Direct implementation of enhanced scope management protocol
- **TodoWrite Integration**: Automatic TodoWrite updates with issue creation tracking
- **Quality Gates**: Issue creation as part of systematic quality assurance
- **Context Extraction**: Issues include context links for conversation continuity

### **Orchestration Integration**
- **Parallel Coordination**: Issue creation runs parallel to main task execution
- **Subagent Integration**: Specialized subagent for issue classification and creation
- **Resource Management**: Issue creation doesn't interrupt main execution flow
- **Validation Framework**: Created issues follow systematic validation protocols

## COMMAND SYNTAX & USAGE

### **Manual Invocation**
```
/parallel-issue-create [scope_expansion_percentage] [discovered_tasks...]
```

### **Automatic Activation**
- Triggered automatically when scope expansion >20% detected
- Integrated into core.md execution protocol (steps 18a-18f)
- Activated during TodoWrite monitoring when out-of-scope tasks identified

### **Batch Processing Mode**
```
/parallel-issue-create batch [task_list_file]
```

## SUCCESS METRICS

### **Scope Management Effectiveness**
- **Scope Containment**: Original tasks completed within planned scope
- **Discovery Capture**: 100% of discovered tasks captured as trackable issues
- **Context Preservation**: Complete traceability between conversations and issues
- **Workflow Continuity**: Zero interruption to main execution flow

### **Issue Quality Standards**
- **Complete Context**: All issues include conversation links and context references
- **Accurate Classification**: Micro/complex/enhancement classification >90% accuracy
- **Priority Alignment**: Issue priorities align with actual system impact and user needs
- **Follow-up Enablement**: Issues provide sufficient context for future execution
