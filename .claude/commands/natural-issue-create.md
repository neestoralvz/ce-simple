# /natural-issue-create - Natural Issue Creation Protocol

**31/07/2025 CDMX** | Natural language issue creation with context-aware classification and automatic workflow integration

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
@context/architecture/orchestration.md ‚Üí natural-issue-create.md implements natural conversation patterns per L4-Pure Orchestration methodology

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Natural language issue creation preserving conversation flow while capturing complete context"** - Enable intuitive issue creation through natural conversation patterns without disrupting dialogue flow or losing contextual information.

## NATURAL CONVERSATION PATTERNS

### **Conversational Issue Triggers**
Natural language patterns that automatically trigger issue creation:

```
NATURAL TRIGGERS:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "This would be good to track as an issue"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "We should create an issue for this"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "Let's file this for later"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "This needs its own issue"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "Can you create an issue for [task]?"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "Add this to the backlog"
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ "Track this separately"
```

### **Context-Aware Detection**
Automatic detection during conversation flow:
- **Scope Expansion**: Tasks discovered during execution requiring separate attention
- **Future Work**: Enhancements or improvements mentioned during implementation
- **Related Tasks**: Dependencies or follow-up work identified during discussion
- **Documentation Needs**: Documentation or process improvements discovered

## NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING

### **Intent Recognition Framework**
```
CONVERSATION ANALYSIS:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EXPLICIT REQUEST: Direct user request for issue creation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IMPLIED NEED: Task complexity suggests separate tracking
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SCOPE DISCOVERY: Work discovered outside current objectives
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION: Process improvements identified
```

### **Context Extraction Protocol**
**Automatic Context Capture**:
1. **Conversation Context**: Current discussion topic and background
2. **Technical Context**: Files, components, or systems being discussed
3. **User Intent**: Explicit or implied user goals and objectives
4. **Priority Indicators**: Urgency or importance signals from conversation

### **Smart Classification System**
```
NATURAL CLASSIFICATION:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ URGENCY INDICATORS: "urgent", "critical", "asap", "blocking" ‚Üí HIGH priority
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TIMELINE REFERENCES: "later", "future", "someday" ‚Üí LOW priority
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ COMPLEXITY SIGNALS: "simple", "quick", "easy" ‚Üí MICRO-TASK
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SCOPE INDICATORS: "comprehensive", "overhaul", "redesign" ‚Üí COMPLEX-TASK
```

## CONVERSATION-FIRST WORKFLOW

### **Seamless Integration Protocol**
1. **Continue Conversation**: Issue creation doesn't interrupt natural dialogue flow
2. **Context Preservation**: Complete conversation context captured in issue
3. **Reference Linking**: Automatic bidirectional linking between conversation and issue
4. **Follow-up Enablement**: Issues provide sufficient context for future execution

### **Natural Language Template Generation**
Instead of rigid templates, use conversational structure:

```markdown
# [Natural Title from Conversation]

**Found during**: [Conversation topic/context]
**Mentioned by**: [User/System] while discussing [context]

## What we discovered
[Natural description preserving conversation tone]

## Why this matters
[Context and rationale from conversation]

## What needs to happen
- [ ] [Action items in natural language]
- [ ] [Additional steps identified]

## Context from conversation
- **Discussion**: [Link to conversation]
- **Related work**: [Current objectives]
- **Timeline context**: [When this was discovered]

---
**Created naturally during conversation** | **Context preserved**
```

## WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

### **TodoWrite Integration**
- **Automatic Addition**: Issues automatically added to TodoWrite for tracking
- **Status Synchronization**: Issue status updates reflect in TodoWrite
- **Priority Alignment**: TodoWrite priorities align with issue classifications
- **Context Linking**: Complete traceability between TodoWrite and issues

### **Conversation Continuity**
- **No Interruption**: Issue creation happens in background
- **Status Updates**: Brief confirmations without disrupting flow
- **Context Preservation**: Full conversation context captured
- **Reference Availability**: Issues immediately available for reference

### **Natural Confirmation Patterns**
```
CONFIRMATION STYLES:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "‚úì Tracked: [Brief description] as Issue #X"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "üìù Added to backlog: [Title] (Issue #X)"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "üéØ Created issue for [task] - continuing with [current work]"
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ "Issue #X created for [context] - available for future work"
```

## COMMAND EXECUTION MODES

### **Interactive Mode**
```bash
User: "We should create an issue for improving the documentation"
System: ‚úì Created Issue #42: "Improve documentation" - continuing with current task
```

### **Explicit Mode**
```bash
/natural-issue-create "Add validation to user input" --priority medium
```

### **Batch Mode**
```bash
User: "Let's track these three things: validation, error handling, and performance optimization"
System: ‚úì Created 3 issues: #43 (validation), #44 (error handling), #45 (performance) - all linked to current conversation
```

## SMART DEFAULTS SYSTEM

### **Context-Aware Defaults**
- **Priority**: Inferred from conversation urgency and user tone
- **Timeline**: Based on user language patterns ("later" = low priority, "soon" = medium)
- **Classification**: Automatic categorization based on complexity indicators
- **Labels**: Auto-generated from conversation context and technical domain

### **Learning Adaptation**
- **User Patterns**: Learn from user's issue creation patterns and preferences
- **Context Recognition**: Improve context detection based on successful issue resolutions
- **Priority Alignment**: Adapt priority classification to match user's actual prioritization
- **Workflow Integration**: Optimize integration based on user workflow patterns

## QUALITY ASSURANCE

### **Context Completeness Validation**
- **Conversation Link**: Every issue links back to creating conversation
- **Technical Context**: Relevant files, components, systems referenced
- **User Intent**: Clear understanding of user's objectives captured
- **Action Clarity**: Next steps are clearly defined and actionable

### **Natural Language Quality**
- **Conversational Tone**: Issues read naturally, not robotically
- **Context Preservation**: Original conversation context and tone maintained
- **Clarity**: Technical and non-technical stakeholders can understand
- **Completeness**: Sufficient information for future implementation

## SUCCESS METRICS

### **User Experience Metrics**
- **Conversation Flow**: Zero interruption to natural dialogue
- **Context Accuracy**: 95%+ accuracy in capturing user intent
- **Follow-up Success**: Issues provide sufficient context for future work
- **User Satisfaction**: Natural, intuitive issue creation experience

### **Technical Metrics**
- **Classification Accuracy**: 90%+ correct automatic classification
- **Context Completeness**: 100% conversation context preservation
- **Integration Success**: Seamless TodoWrite and workflow integration
- **Reference Integrity**: Complete traceability and linking

## COMMAND SYNTAX

### **Natural Invocation**
No rigid syntax required - natural conversation patterns trigger automatically:
- "Can you track this as an issue?"
- "Let's create an issue for the validation work"
- "This should be its own issue"

### **Explicit Invocation**
```bash
/natural-issue-create [description] [--priority low|medium|high] [--type micro|complex|enhancement]
```

### **Batch Invocation**
```bash
/natural-issue-create batch [conversation_context]
```
