# init-project

**Purpose**: Project initialization with Git WorkTrees via 5 Task Tool agents

## Execution: 2 Steps

### Step 1: Deploy 5 Parallel Setup Agents with Individual Reporting
```markdown
Task Tool execution: 5 concurrent setup agents with mandatory individual user reporting

Agent 1 (Task Tool): "Git init via Bash 'git init; git branch main; git worktree add worktrees/feature'"
→ **INDIVIDUAL REPORT TO USER**: Agent 1 will report Git WorkTree setup status directly to you before synthesis

Agent 2 (Task Tool): "Directory creation via Write src/main.py docs/README.md tests/test_main.py"
→ **INDIVIDUAL REPORT TO USER**: Agent 2 will report project structure creation directly to you before synthesis

Agent 3 (Task Tool): "Config generation via Write package.json .gitignore Makefile pyproject.toml"
→ **INDIVIDUAL REPORT TO USER**: Agent 3 will report configuration files status directly to you before synthesis

Agent 4 (Task Tool): "Documentation via Write README.md docs/ARCHITECTURE.md CONTRIBUTING.md"
→ **INDIVIDUAL REPORT TO USER**: Agent 4 will report documentation creation directly to you before synthesis

Agent 5 (Task Tool): "Validation via Bash 'ls -la; git status; python --version'"
→ **INDIVIDUAL REPORT TO USER**: Agent 5 will report validation results directly to you before synthesis

**TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENT**: Each agent MUST report setup progress individually to user
**ISOLATION**: Each agent operates on separate file paths to prevent conflicts
```

### Step 2: Individual Agent Reporting & Parallel Validation
**MANDATORY**: Each deployed agent reports results directly to user with clear attribution:
- Agent identification: "Agent X Setup Results"
- Specific setup tasks completed in assigned area
- File creation status and any issues encountered
- Validation confirmation before final synthesis

After individual reports: Agents 1-4 execute simultaneously with Agent 5 validating complete setup and Git WorkTrees ready for conflict-free parallel development.

## Success Metrics
- Setup completion: <3 minutes with 5 parallel agents
- Git WorkTrees configured: Main, feature, analysis, docs, experimental branches
- Project structure: Complete and validated
- 10x speedup vs sequential setup

**Implementation**: Real Task Tool parallelization with actual Git WorkTree setup.
