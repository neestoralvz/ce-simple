# Agent Fault Tolerance - Multi-Agent System Resilience

## 2025 MULTI-AGENT FAULT TOLERANCE ARCHITECTURE

### Agent Redundancy Patterns (Research-Driven)

```markdown
REDUNDANCY STRATEGIES:

ACTIVE-PASSIVE REDUNDANCY:
- Primary Agent: Handles normal operations
- Passive Backup: Mirrors primary state, ready for immediate takeover
- Heartbeat Monitoring: Continuous health checks between primary and backup
- State Synchronization: Real-time state replication to backup agents

ACTIVE-ACTIVE REDUNDANCY:
- Multiple Agents: Process requests simultaneously
- Load Distribution: Intelligent request routing across active agents
- Consensus Mechanism: Agreement protocol for conflicting outputs
- Performance Optimization: Dynamic load balancing based on agent performance

N+1 REDUNDANCY MODEL:
- N Active Agents: Handle normal workload distribution
- +1 Standby Agent: Ready for immediate deployment on any agent failure
- Automatic Failover: Seamless transition without service interruption
- Capacity Planning: Ensure N agents can handle full load during failure
```
