## ENHANCED MONITORING ARCHITECTURE

### 2025 Best Practice Integration
Based on research findings, implementing AI-powered monitoring patterns:

```yaml
Monitoring Dimensions:
  predictive_analytics: "AI-driven failure prediction"
  anomaly_detection: "Pattern deviation identification"
  performance_correlation: "Cross-command impact analysis"
  voice_integrity_tracking: "User voice preservation metrics"
  contextflow_efficiency: "Context loading optimization"
```

### Expanded Health Metrics Framework

#### 1. Command Execution Metrics
```sql
CREATE TABLE command_execution (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    command_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    execution_start TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    execution_end TIMESTAMP,
    duration_ms INTEGER,
    success_status BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    user_voice_score REAL,
    context_preservation_score REAL,
    token_efficiency REAL,
    subagent_coordination_count INTEGER,
    errors_encountered TEXT,
    performance_metrics TEXT,
    session_id TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 2. Predictive Performance Tracking
```sql
CREATE TABLE predictive_metrics (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    command_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    predicted_duration INTEGER,
    actual_duration INTEGER,
    accuracy_score REAL,
    resource_usage_prediction TEXT,
    failure_probability REAL,
    optimization_recommendations TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

ALTER TABLE voice_preservation ADD COLUMN preservation_methodology TEXT;
ALTER TABLE voice_preservation ADD COLUMN violation_detection TEXT;
```

### Real-Time Dashboard Enhancement

  - Command success rate (new metric)
  - Average execution time by tier (new metric)

Performance Heatmap:
  - Command frequency usage patterns
  - Success/failure distribution by command
  - Token efficiency visualization
  - Context loading performance metrics

Predictive Analytics Panel:
