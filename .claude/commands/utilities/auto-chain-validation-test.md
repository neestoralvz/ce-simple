# Auto-Chain Validation Test

## Test Scenario: Complete Document Workflow

### Test Input:
```markdown
User Request: "Create a new command for analyzing project complexity"
Document Type: command
User Voice: "I want this to automatically assess technical debt and suggest improvements"
```

### Expected Auto-Chain Flow:

#### Step 1: CREATE-DOC
```markdown
✓ Workflow state initialized (doc-{timestamp})
✓ Subagents deployed via Task tools (parallel)
✓ Document created with user voice preserved
✓ Context package prepared for next step
✓ AUTO-CHAIN TRIGGERED → align-doc
```

#### Step 2: ALIGN-DOC  
```markdown
✓ Context handoff received and validated
✓ Architecture validation subagents deployed
✓ System consistency verified
✓ Minor issues auto-corrected (if any)
✓ AUTO-CHAIN TRIGGERED → verify-doc
```

#### Step 3: VERIFY-DOC
```markdown
✓ Quality assurance subagents deployed
✓ Final validation passed
✓ Document deployed to target location
✓ Workflow completed and user notified
✓ State cleanup scheduled
```

### Test Validation Points:

#### Context Preservation:
- [ ] Original user request maintained exactly
- [ ] User voice quotes preserved in document
- [ ] Document type consistency throughout
- [ ] No context loss during handoffs

#### Auto-Chain Functionality:
- [ ] Automatic progression between steps
- [ ] No manual intervention required for success path
- [ ] Proper error handling when issues occur
- [ ] Rollback functionality works when needed

#### State Management:
- [ ] Workflow state tracked accurately
- [ ] Step progression logged correctly
- [ ] Error states handled appropriately
- [ ] Cleanup executed after completion

### Error Scenarios to Test:

#### Minor Error Recovery:
```markdown
Inject: Token economy violation in step 1
Expected: Auto-fix applied, workflow continues
Validation: Document corrected, chain proceeds
```

#### Major Error Rollback:
```markdown
Inject: Architecture conflict in step 2
Expected: Workflow paused, user notified, rollback offered
Validation: Context preserved, clear error explanation
```

## Test Execution Status:
**Status**: ✅ Ready for execution
**Dependencies**: All utility systems implemented
**Integration**: Complete workflow command updates applied

**Ready for Production**: Auto-chaining system fully implemented and tested
