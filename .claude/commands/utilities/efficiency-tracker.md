# Efficiency Tracker - Decision Tree Performance Measurement

## Purpose
Automated measurement system para decision tree effectiveness + command efficiency optimization.

## Measurement Dimensions

### Decision Tree Performance
```yaml
metrics:
  context_loading_speed: "milliseconds to load relevant context"
  decision_accuracy: "percentage of relevant command suggestions"
  path_efficiency: "steps to optimal command execution"  
  user_satisfaction: "command selection alignment with intent"
```

### Command Usage Analytics
```yaml
tracking:
  frequency: "how often each command is used"
  success_rate: "percentage of successful completions"
  chaining_patterns: "most common command sequences"
  user_preference_evolution: "changes in usage over time"
```

### Token Economy Compliance
```yaml
monitoring:
  file_size_distribution: "adherence to 50-80 line targets"
  context_loading_efficiency: "tokens used vs information density"
  optimization_opportunities: "files exceeding targets"
  division_effectiveness: "core vs extensions performance"
```

## Auto-Measurement Protocol

### Continuous Monitoring (Via Subagent)
```
Research Specialist: Monitor external best practices evolution
Architecture Validator: Track internal system coherence metrics
Content Optimizer: Measure token economy effectiveness  
Voice Preservation: Validate user intent maintenance accuracy
Quality Assurance: Assess overall system health indicators
```

### Performance Data Collection
```yaml
session_metrics:
  commands_used: ["list of commands in order"]
  execution_time: "total time from request to completion"
  context_loaded: "amount of context required"
  user_corrections: "times user had to clarify/redirect"
  satisfaction_indicators: "implicit success signals"
```

### Efficiency Calculation Algorithm
```python
# Pseudo-code for efficiency scoring
def calculate_efficiency(session_data):
    decision_speed = context_loading_time / relevance_score
    execution_effectiveness = successful_completions / total_attempts  
    user_alignment = correct_interpretations / total_interactions
    resource_optimization = information_density / tokens_used
    
    efficiency_score = weighted_average([
        decision_speed * 0.25,
        execution_effectiveness * 0.30,
        user_alignment * 0.30,
        resource_optimization * 0.15
    ])
    
    return efficiency_score
```

## Optimization Triggers

### Automatic Optimization Suggestions
```yaml
triggers:
  low_efficiency_score: "< 0.75 efficiency for command/pattern"
  high_context_loading: "> 3s average context assembly time"
  poor_decision_accuracy: "< 85% relevant command suggestions"
  token_economy_violations: "> 20% files exceeding size targets"
  user_correction_frequency: "> 15% interactions require clarification"
```

### Improvement Recommendations
```yaml
optimization_types:
  command_consolidation: "merge similar/overlapping commands"
  decision_tree_refinement: "improve context loading algorithms"  
  context_optimization: "reduce unnecessary information loading"
  user_pattern_adaptation: "adjust to evolving user preferences"
  architecture_simplification: "eliminate complexity without losing capability"
```

## Subagent Integration

### Research Specialist Monitoring
```
Task: "Monitor decision tree best practices evolution"
Frequency: Weekly
Output: Recommendations for decision algorithm improvements
Integration: Auto-update decision tree optimization parameters
```

### Architecture Validator Assessment  
```
Task: "Validate system coherence + integration effectiveness"
Frequency: Per major system change
Output: Consistency scores + integration health metrics
Integration: Architecture adjustment suggestions when coherence drops
```

### Content Optimizer Analysis
```
Task: "Analyze token economy compliance + optimization opportunities"
Frequency: Daily
Output: File size compliance report + division recommendations
Integration: Auto-trigger file optimization when targets exceeded
```

## Measurement Dashboard Format

### Real-Time Metrics Display
```yaml
current_session:
  efficiency_score: 0.87
  context_loading_avg: "1.2s"
  decision_accuracy: "92%"
  user_corrections: 2
  
system_health:
  token_economy_compliance: "95% (17/18 files)"
  command_usage_distribution: "balanced"

  architecture_coherence: "stable"

optimization_queue:
  - "Consider consolidating /analyze + /explore commands"
  - "Optimize context loading for /process-layer"
  - "Review decision tree for /start command efficiency"
```

### Historical Trend Analysis
```yaml
performance_trends:
  efficiency_evolution: "trending upward +0.12 over 30 days"
  most_improved_commands: ["/start", "/verify-doc"]
  optimization_impact: "token economy compliance +15%"
