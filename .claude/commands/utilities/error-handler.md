# Centralized Error Handler - 2025 Research Implementation

## ERROR HANDLING ARCHITECTURE (2025 RESEARCH-DRIVEN)

### Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy (MAST Integration)
Based on 2025 research identifying 14 unique failure modes in 3 categories:

```markdown
CATEGORY 1: ORCHESTRATION FAILURES
- Task Distribution Errors
- Agent Communication Breakdowns
- Context Synchronization Issues
- Workflow State Corruption

CATEGORY 2: AGENT-SPECIFIC FAILURES  
- LLM Response Degradation
- Tool Integration Failures
- Memory/Context Overflow
- Execution Timeout Events

CATEGORY 3: SYSTEM-LEVEL FAILURES
- Resource Exhaustion
- Authentication/Permission Issues
- Network/Connectivity Problems
- Critical System Component Failures
```

### Centralized Exception Tracking (2025 Standard)

```json
{
  "error_registry": {
    "request_id": "req_{timestamp}_{uuid}",
    "error_classification": {
      "mast_category": "orchestration|agent|system",
      "severity_level": 1-4,
      "error_code": "standardized_code",
      "failure_attribution": {
        "responsible_agent": "agent_id",
        "failure_step": "step_number",
        "root_cause": "technical_description"
      }
    },
    "centralized_aggregation": {
      "correlation_id": "groups related errors",
      "incident_timeline": "chronological tracking",
      "impact_assessment": "affected operations"
    }
  }
}
```

## INTELLIGENT ERROR RECOVERY (RESEARCH-DRIVEN)

### Circuit Breaker Implementation
```markdown
CIRCUIT STATES:
- CLOSED: Normal operation, errors tracked
- OPEN: Failure threshold exceeded, requests blocked
- HALF-OPEN: Testing recovery, limited requests allowed

FAILURE THRESHOLDS (2025 RESEARCH):
- Agent Response Failures: 3 consecutive failures
- Tool Integration Issues: 5 failures in 10 attempts  
- Context Loading Problems: 2 failures in sequence
- Workflow State Corruption: 1 failure (immediate circuit open)

RECOVERY TESTING:
- Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s intervals
- Health check validation before full recovery
- Gradual load increase upon successful recovery
```

### Automated Failure Attribution System

```markdown
FAILURE ATTRIBUTION PROTOCOL:
Task: Error Attribution Specialist
Description: "Identify responsible agent and failure step"
Subagent: error-analysis
Prompt: "Analyze failure attribution for error {error_id}:

ERROR CONTEXT:
- Request ID: {request_id}
- Workflow Step: {current_step}
- Agent Chain: {agent_execution_chain}
- Error Details: {error_description}

ATTRIBUTION ANALYSIS:
1. Trace execution path to point of failure
2. Identify last successful agent operation
3. Analyze error propagation through agent chain
4. Determine root cause vs cascading failure
5. Classify failure mode using MAST taxonomy
6. Generate improvement recommendations

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  'responsible_agent': 'agent_identifier',
  'failure_step': 'step_number',
  'root_cause': 'technical_description',
  'mast_classification': 'category_and_mode',
  'recovery_strategy': 'recommended_approach'
}"
```

### Multi-Layered Guardrails System

```markdown
LAYER 1: PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION
Task: Pre-Execution Validator
Description: "Validate system readiness before command execution"
Subagent: validation-specialist
Prompt: "Pre-execution validation for command {command_name}:

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
- System health status verification
- Required resources availability check
- Context loading prerequisites validation
- Agent readiness confirmation
- Circuit breaker status assessment
- Previous error state clearance

BLOCKING CONDITIONS:
- Critical system components unavailable
- Resource exhaustion detected
- Open circuit breaker for required services
- Unresolved critical errors in context
- Agent deployment prerequisites not met

OUTPUT: PROCEED/BLOCK with detailed status report"

LAYER 2: REAL-TIME EXECUTION MONITORING
- Token consumption tracking
- Response quality validation
- Context preservation verification
- Agent communication monitoring
- Performance threshold enforcement

LAYER 3: POST-EXECUTION VALIDATION
- Output quality assessment
- Context integrity verification
- Error state analysis
- Performance metrics collection
- Success/failure classification
```

## ERROR RECOVERY ORCHESTRATION

### Graceful Degradation Strategies

```markdown
DEGRADATION LEVELS:

LEVEL 1: OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE
- All agents operational
- Full feature availability
- Normal response times
- Complete workflow execution

LEVEL 2: REDUCED FUNCTIONALITY
- Non-critical agents offline
- Core features available
- Slightly increased response times
- Essential workflows operational

LEVEL 3: MINIMAL OPERATION
- Only critical agents active
- Basic functionality only
- Significant performance impact
- Emergency workflows only

LEVEL 4: EMERGENCY MODE
- Core system preservation
- Read-only operations
- User notification active
- Recovery procedures initiated
```

### Dynamic Agent Replacement

```markdown
AGENT REPLACEMENT PROTOCOL:
Task: Agent Replacement Manager
Description: "Replace failed agent with backup instance"
Subagent: orchestration-manager
Prompt: "Execute agent replacement for failed {agent_type}:

REPLACEMENT CONTEXT:
- Failed Agent: {agent_id}
- Failure Reason: {failure_description}
- Current Workflow State: {state_snapshot}
- Replacement Agent: {backup_agent_id}

REPLACEMENT ACTIONS:
1. Preserve current workflow state and context
2. Initialize replacement agent with preserved state
3. Transfer in-progress operations to replacement
4. Update agent registry and routing tables
5. Resume operations from point of failure
6. Monitor replacement agent performance
7. Log replacement event for analysis

STATE PRESERVATION:
- User voice and context quotes
- Workflow progression markers
- Intermediate results and outputs
- User preferences and customizations
- Error recovery context"
```

if error_status.blocking_conditions:
  return error_handler.handle_blocking_error(error_status)

# Command Execution with Monitoring
try:
  result = await execute_command_with_monitoring()
except Exception as e:
  return error_handler.handle_execution_error(e, context)

# Post-Command Validation
