## üöÄ EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Plan Discovery & Analysis (Parallel: 4-8 operations)
```javascript
// Comprehensive plan discovery
Glob("**/*plan*") +
Glob("**/*task*") + 
Glob("**/*cleanup*") +
Glob("**/*maintenance*") +
Grep("task.*list|todo.*list|phase.*\d+", {output_mode: "files_with_matches"}) +
Grep("batch.*\d+|step.*\d+|cleanup.*plan", {output_mode: "files_with_matches"}) +
Grep("parallel|concurrent|simultaneous", {output_mode: "files_with_matches"}) +
Grep("dependency|sequence|order", {output_mode: "files_with_matches"})
```

### Phase 2: Task Structure Analysis (Parallel: 6-12 operations)  
```javascript
// Deep task analysis
Read("identified_plan_file") +
Grep("^\s*\d+\.|^\s*-\s|\*\s", {output_mode: "content"}) + // List items
Grep("phase|step|batch|task", {output_mode: "content", "-C": 2}) +
Grep("depend|require|after|before", {output_mode: "content", "-C": 1}) +
Grep("parallel|concurrent|sync|async", {output_mode: "content", "-C": 1}) +
Grep("file|directory|path", {output_mode: "content"}) + // Resource conflicts
Grep("create|modify|delete|update", {output_mode: "content"}) + // Operation types
Grep("validation|check|verify|test", {output_mode: "content"}) // Checkpoints
```

### Phase 3: Parallelization Analysis (Core Algorithm)
```yaml
Dependency Graph Construction:
  - Parse task list into structured format
  - Identify explicit dependencies (after, before, requires)
  - Map resource conflicts (file modifications, database operations)
  - Build directed acyclic graph (DAG) of task relationships

Parallel Batch Identification:
  - Group independent tasks into parallel batches
  - Optimize batch sizes for resource utilization
  - Calculate parallel execution timing estimates
  - Identify bottleneck tasks and critical paths

Risk Assessment Matrix:
  - Evaluate safety of parallel execution per task
  - Identify potential race conditions and conflicts
  - Assess checkpoint integrity with parallel execution
  - Generate mitigation strategies for identified risks
```

### Phase 4: Optimization Recommendations (Parallel: 3-6 operations)
```javascript
// Performance analysis
Grep("time|duration|performance", {path: "docs/", output_mode: "content"}) +
Read("docs/core/parallelization-system.md") +
Read("docs/core/performance-system.md") +
Grep("resource|memory|cpu|network", {output_mode: "content"}) +
Bash("nproc") + // CPU core count
Bash("free -h") // Memory availability
```

## üèóÔ∏è PARALLEL EXECUTION FRAMEWORK

### Batch Classification System
```yaml
Class A - Immediate Parallel (No Dependencies):
  - File discovery operations (Glob patterns)
  - Independent analysis tasks (Grep searches)
  - Read-only validation operations
  - Documentation generation tasks
  - Estimation: 90%+ tasks can execute immediately

Class B - Sequential Dependencies (Ordered):
  - File creation ‚Üí content population
  - Directory creation ‚Üí file placement  
  - Validation ‚Üí correction ‚Üí re-validation
  - Estimation: 15-25% require specific ordering

Class C - Resource Conflicts (Exclusive):
  - Concurrent file modifications
  - Database transaction operations
  - System configuration changes
  - Estimation: 5-10% require exclusive access

Class D - Checkpoint Dependencies (Gated):
  - Validation-dependent operations
  - Quality gate requirements
  - Approval-required changes
  - Estimation: 10-20% require checkpoint completion
```

### Optimization Strategies

#### Maximum Parallelization Pattern
```yaml

  - Batch Size: 8-16 parallel operations per phase
  - Resource Utilization: 85-95% target
  - Timing Target: 5-15x speed improvement
  - Risk Tolerance: Medium (with recovery protocols)

Strategy 2 - Conservative Parallel:
  - Batch Size: 4-8 parallel operations per phase
  - Resource Utilization: 70-85% target  
  - Timing Target: 3-8x speed improvement
  - Risk Tolerance: Low (high safety margins)

Strategy 3 - Hybrid Approach:
  - Class A: Maximum parallelization (16+ concurrent)
  - Class B: Sequential execution with parallel prep
  - Class C: Exclusive execution with parallel analysis
  - Class D: Parallel validation with sequential gates
```

#### Resource Allocation Framework
```yaml
CPU Optimization:
  - Core Count Assessment: Use all available cores

    ) + critical_path.overhead
    
    # Resource scaling factors
    resource_factor = calculate_resource_scaling(resources)
