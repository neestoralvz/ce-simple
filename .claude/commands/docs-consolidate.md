# Docs Consolidate - Content Unification and Reference Repair

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Systematically unify duplicated content, repair broken references, and consolidate fragmented information while maintaining system architectural integrity.

## ðŸš€ Usage
Execute: `/docs-consolidate [scope]`

## ðŸ”§ Implementation

### Consolidation Protocol
**Sequential Execution**: Execute in dependency order to prevent reference breaks during consolidation
**Duplication Resolution**: Identify and merge overlapping content with authoritative source establishment
**Reference Repair**: Fix broken cross-references, create missing targets, ensure bidirectional linking
**Progressive Disclosure**: Extract verbose content from commands to ../../standards/context layers

### Consolidation Strategy Framework
**High Priority** (>40% overlap): Merge files with substantial duplication, establish single sources
**Medium Priority** (20-40% overlap): Consolidate sections, standardize terminology and explanations
**Low Priority** (<20% overlap): Optimize cross-references, standardize formatting conventions

### Content Organization System
**Commands** (â‰¤140 optimal): Extract educational content â†’ context, detailed criteria â†’ standards  
**Standards** (â‰¤200 max): Consolidate frameworks, unify criteria, establish authoritative guidelines
**Context** (â‰¤200 max): Consolidate patterns, document relationships, preserve historical decisions

### Quality Assurance Framework
**Success Metrics**: <5% duplication, 100% functional references, file size compliance, â‰¤2.5 navigation steps
**Validation Checklist**: All references functional, no information loss, size compliance, boundaries maintained
**Integrity Preservation**: System coherence maintained throughout consolidation operations

## âš¡ Triggers

### Input Triggers
**Context**: Post-audit identification of content duplication and reference issues requiring unification
**Previous**: `/docs-audit` identified consolidation requirements or direct duplication resolution needs
**Keywords**: consolidate, unify, merge, repair, references, duplication

### Output Triggers
**Success**: Content unified â†’ `/docs-optimize` for standards compliance application
**Complete**: Complex consolidation â†’ `/docs-validate` for architecture verification
**Workflow**: Automated path â†’ `/docs-workflow` for complete optimization integration
**Chain**: audit â†’ consolidate â†’ optimize â†’ validate (workflow completion)

### Success Patterns
**Consolidation Success**: <5% content duplication â†’ Architectural integrity achieved
**Reference Success**: 100% functional links â†’ Navigation completeness verified
**Size Success**: All files compliant â†’ Progressive disclosure effectiveness demonstrated

**CRITICAL**: This command transforms system architecture through consolidation while maintaining information completeness and functional integrity. All consolidation operations must preserve essential content value.
