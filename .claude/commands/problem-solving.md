# Problem-Solving - Universal Error Resolution Workflow

## üéØ Purpose
Universal methodology for systematic problem resolution through structured diagnosis, comprehensive research, and progressive analysis leading to executable solution plans.

## üöÄ Usage
**Auto-Triggered**: Activated automatically when errors/problems detected
**Manual**: Execute `/problem-solving [error-description]`

## üîß Implementation

### Enhanced Behavioral Reinforcement Protocol
**MANDATORY at problem-solving initialization**:

```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "üîç PHASE 0: Execute pre-solution structural assessment and mapping", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "solve-phase0-1"},
  {"content": "üó∫Ô∏è STRUCTURAL: Generate cross-reference matrix and dependency analysis via /matrix-maintenance", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "solve-structural-1"},
  {"content": "üìä COMPLEXITY: Assess problem complexity and failure patterns", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "solve-complexity-1"},
  {"content": "üîó INTEGRATION: Deploy explore-codebase + explore-web with validation protocols", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "solve-integration-1"},
  {"content": "üß† ANALYSIS: Apply think-layers for multi-phase resolution planning", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "solve-analysis-1"},
  {"content": "üõ°Ô∏è PREVENTION: Generate risk assessment and mitigation strategies", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "solve-prevention-1"},
  {"content": "‚úÖ SOLUTION: Create executable solution plan with failure prevention", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "solve-solution-1"}
])
```

**Problem-Adaptive Todos**: Add specific todos based on problem type and complexity discovered during diagnosis

### Enhanced Resolution Protocol
**Sequential Execution**: 6-phase methodology with mandatory structural assessment
**Integration**: Leverages cross-reference matrix and enhanced command integration
**Auto-Trigger**: Activated on error detection with failure prevention protocols
**Progressive Analysis**: Escalating depth with structural validation at each phase

### Enhanced Execution Framework
**Phase 0**: Pre-solution structural assessment and dependency mapping
**Phase 1**: Cross-reference matrix generation and failure pattern analysis
**Phase 2**: Enhanced internal context discovery using /explore-codebase with validation
**Phase 3**: Comprehensive external research using /explore-web with cross-validation
**Phase 4**: Multi-layer analysis using /think-layers with structural intelligence
**Phase 5**: Risk assessment and prevention planning with mitigation strategies
**Phase 6**: Executable solution planning with comprehensive failure prevention

### Structural Assessment Requirements
**MANDATORY Phase 0**: Before any solution implementation:
- Execute structural mapping of problem domain
- Generate dependency cross-reference matrix via `/matrix-maintenance validate`
- Validate exploration completeness using established protocols
- Assess risk factors and potential failure modes
- Document structural constraints and requirements

## ‚ö° Triggers

### Input Triggers
**Auto-Error**: Automatic activation when problems/errors detected
**Manual**: Direct execution for proactive problem investigation
**Integration**: Called by other commands when resolution needed

### Output Triggers
