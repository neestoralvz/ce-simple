# /capture-learnings - Pattern Extraction System

## Purpose
Orchestrates intelligent learning capture through parallel pattern analysis, dynamic interviews, and systematic documentation extracting actionable insights to evolve system knowledge.

## Principles and Guidelines
- **Dynamic Interviews**: Activate interview process when learning value threshold â‰¥4 
- **Pattern Extraction**: Systematic identification and documentation of recurring patterns
- **Adaptive Analysis**: Parallel pattern identification and value assessment optimization
- **Knowledge Integration**: Preserve existing documentation structure while incorporating new patterns

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Value Assessment & Pattern Discovery
Update TodoWrite mark "learning value assessment" as in_progress

Calculate learning value using assessment framework and Task:
- Apply learning value calculation using assessment metrics
- Execute parallel pattern identification using Read and Grep
- Analyze existing documentation for workflow patterns
- Determine interview activation based on threshold comparison

### Phase 2: Dynamic Interview Execution
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "dynamic interview" as in_progress

Conduct intelligent interview if threshold met using Task:
- Execute interview questions based on identified patterns
- Capture insights through systematic questioning approach
- Document partial insights on interview failures
- Adjust questions dynamically for optimal pattern extraction

### Phase 3: Pattern Extraction & Integration
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "pattern integration" as in_progress

Extract patterns using parallel processing with architectural routing:
- Process interview results and workflow analysis data using Task
- Route user insights to docs/vision/ for strategic planning documentation
- Route technical patterns to docs/context/ for pattern and research documentation
- Integrate patterns maintaining documentation consistency and architectural separation

### Phase 4: System Validation & Documentation
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "learning validation" as in_progress

Validate learning integration using Grep and Task:
- Verify pattern integration system consistency
- Validate learning documentation completeness
- Generate learning integration report with validation results
- Update system documentation with validated insights

Update TodoWrite complete all pattern extraction tasks

**Error Handling**: Skip interview on low learning value, adjust questions dynamically on interview failures, resolve integration conflicts maintaining consistency, roll back changes documenting resolution approach

**Single Responsibility**: Pattern extraction through parallel analysis, dynamic interviews, and systematic documentation enabling continuous system knowledge evolution and improvement.
