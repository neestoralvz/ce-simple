# /system-monitor - Unified System Monitoring System

## Purpose
Orchestrates comprehensive system monitoring through parallel compliance validation, environment health tracking, and performance analysis with real-time reporting and automated optimization recommendations.

## Principles and Guidelines
- **Unified Monitoring**: Consolidate compliance, environment, and performance monitoring into single dashboard
- **Parallel Execution**: Execute concurrent compliance validation, environment monitoring, and performance analysis
- **100% Coverage**: Monitor all system components with 95%+ accuracy
- **Automated Optimization**: Generate performance optimization roadmap with implementation priorities

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Compliance & Environment Monitoring
Update TodoWrite mark "system compliance monitoring" as in_progress

Execute parallel validation using Bash and Grep:
- Validate 150-line limits and execution layer coverage
- Monitor git health, disk usage, and system dependencies
- Check environment stability and dependency status
- Generate compliance violation alerts and corrections

### Phase 2: Performance Metrics & Health Assessment
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "performance health assessment" as in_progress

Collect system metrics using Bash and Task:
- Collect execution times and resource utilization metrics
- Assess overall system health identifying critical issues
- Monitor performance thresholds with violation alerting
- Analyze system resource usage patterns

### Phase 3: Optimization Analysis & Reporting
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "optimization analysis" as in_progress

Generate optimization recommendations using Task:
- Analyze performance data generating optimization recommendations
- Create performance optimization roadmap with priorities
- Document system bottlenecks with improvement strategies
- Generate automated compliance reports with violation details

### Phase 4: Dashboard Consolidation & Documentation
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "system reporting" as in_progress

Create comprehensive system report using Write and Bash:
- Consolidate all monitoring data into unified dashboard
- Generate system health report with metrics and trends
- Document optimization implementation priorities and timeline
- Provide violation alerts with auto-correction suggestions

Update TodoWrite complete all system monitoring tasks

**Error Handling**: Auto-flag oversized files generating correction recommendations, document git conflicts and dependency failures, alert on performance threshold violations, use cached data implementing graceful degradation
