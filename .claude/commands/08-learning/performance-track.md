# /performance-track - Performance Analysis System

## Purpose
Orchestrates comprehensive performance metrics collection and optimization analysis through parallel data gathering, trend analysis, and actionable improvement recommendations.

## Principles and Guidelines
- **Parallel Analysis**: Execute concurrent data collection, log analysis, and trend identification
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Collect execution metrics, resource utilization, and efficiency ratios
- **Trend Identification**: Analyze performance patterns with confidence intervals and anomaly detection
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Generate prioritized optimization roadmap with implementation guidance

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Data Collection & Analysis
Update TodoWrite mark "performance data collection" as in_progress

Execute parallel data gathering using Read, Bash, and Grep:
- Collect execution metrics and resource utilization data
- Extract performance data from system logs and outputs
- Analyze performance patterns across different system scopes
- Validate data completeness and accuracy metrics

### Phase 2: Trend Analysis & Efficiency Calculation
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "performance trend analysis" as in_progress

Process performance data using Task and Bash:
- Identify performance patterns and trend analysis
- Calculate efficiency ratios and utilization metrics
- Validate unusual patterns with confidence intervals
- Estimate metrics from available sources flagging gaps

### Phase 3: Optimization Identification
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "optimization identification" as in_progress

Analyze bottlenecks using Task optimization analysis:
- Identify performance bottlenecks and improvement opportunities
- Generate optimization priorities based on impact analysis
- Create actionable implementation roadmap with specific steps
- Validate optimization recommendations against system constraints

### Phase 4: Report Generation & Documentation
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "performance reporting" as in_progress

Generate comprehensive performance report using Write and Task:
- Consolidate metrics into performance dashboard format
- Document prioritized optimization recommendations
- Create implementation roadmap with timeline estimates
- Provide scope-specific analysis based on execution parameters

Update TodoWrite complete all performance analysis tasks

**Error Handling**: Estimate metrics from available sources flagging data gaps, validate unusual patterns providing confidence intervals, use partial data documenting limitations, generate summary reports retrying analysis
