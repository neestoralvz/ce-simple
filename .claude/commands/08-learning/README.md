# 08-learning - Learning & Pattern Commands

## Purpose
Continuous learning and pattern extraction system. These commands capture insights, identify patterns, and evolve system capabilities through intelligent analysis of successes, failures, and optimization opportunities.

## Commands
- `/capture-learnings` - Pattern extraction and documentation with interview-driven learning
- `/interview-feedback` - Systematic user feedback capture via structured interview process
- `/system-monitor` - Unified system monitoring with compliance validation and performance metrics
- `/system-monitor-agents` - Agent health monitoring and status tracking for orchestration systems
- `/performance-track` - Performance metrics collection and optimization analysis

### Planned Commands (Future Development)
- `/pattern-analyze` - Pattern analysis and classification
- `/success-study` - Success factor analysis and replication
- `/failure-analyze` - Failure analysis and prevention strategies
- `/evolution-guide` - System evolution and improvement guidance

## Category Relations
- **Fed by**: All categories for learning input
- **Feeds into**: 00-core for system improvements
- **Coordinates with**: 06-documentation for knowledge capture
- **Uses**: 12-math for pattern quantification
