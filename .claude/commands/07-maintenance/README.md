# 07-maintenance - Maintenance & Optimization Commands

## Purpose
System maintenance, optimization, and continuous improvement. These commands ensure long-term system health, performance optimization, and automated maintenance procedures.

## Commands
- `/context-optimize` - Intelligent context consolidation and memory optimization
- `/system-optimize` - Comprehensive system optimization
- `/maintenance-auto` - Automated maintenance procedures
- `/performance-tune` - Performance tuning and optimization
- `/cleanup-intelligent` - Intelligent cleanup and organization
- `/health-monitor` - Continuous health monitoring and alerts

*Note: Meta-level commands (matrix-maintenance, command-maintain) moved to 11-meta category*
*Note: Git worktree management commands (worktree-cleanup) moved to 09-git category*

## Category Relations
- **Triggered by**: 05-validation, 08-learning for improvements
- **Coordinates with**: 12-math for performance metrics
- **Uses**: 14-utils for maintenance utilities
- **Reports to**: 00-core for system status

## Usage Patterns
```
08-learning/patterns → 07-maintenance/context-optimize → memory optimization
12-math/metrics → 07-maintenance/system-optimize → performance tuning
00-core/health → 07-maintenance/health-monitor → system monitoring
07-maintenance/performance-tune → optimization feedback loops
```
