# Implementation Quality Orchestrator

**Command**: `/start-implementation-audit`  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive validation of current implementation vs user requirements  
**Agents**: 12 parallel sub-agents via Task Tool  
**Authority**: user-input/technical-requirements/ Sacred User Space

## Command Execution

5. Report gaps and compliance recommendations

### Agent 2: start Command Audit  
**Task**: Validate .claude/commands/start.md against parallel execution requirements
1. Read .claude/commands/start.md completely
2. Validate parallel execution: 8-16 searches, 5-10 files, 4-8 analysis
3. Validate Git WorkTrees integration: Conflict-free parallel operations
4. Check error recovery framework: Phase/command/system level recovery
5. Report performance metrics and implementation gaps

### Agent 3: init-project Command Audit
**Task**: Validate .claude/commands/init-project.md against autocontainment requirements
1. Read .claude/commands/init-project.md completely
2. Validate technical autocontainment: All templates embedded inline
3. Validate intelligent orchestration: Crystallized intelligence patterns
4. Check domain versatility: Web dev, research, documentation, office, tenders
5. Report autocontainment and orchestration deficiencies

### Agent 4: docs-audit Command Audit
**Task**: Validate .claude/commands/docs-audit.md against transparency requirements
1. Read .claude/commands/docs-audit.md completely
2. Validate process transparency: Individual agent progress reporting
3. Validate user intervention capability: Monitor, evaluate, intervene
4. Check 95%+ automatic recovery without human intervention
5. Report transparency framework and control gaps

### Agent 5-8: docs/core/ Structure Compliance
**Task**: Validate docs/core/ 6-layer structure against user requirements
1. Validate PTS 12-component framework implementation
2. Check command governance authority hierarchy
3. Assess foundation principles against user-input/vision/
4. Validate cross-layer integration and coherence
5. Report structural and integration deficiencies

### Agent 9: export/commands/ Library Validation
**Task**: Validate 86 commands in 15 categories claim
1. Sample 5-8 commands across different categories
2. Validate self-containment across command library
3. Check consistency with .claude/commands/ core approach
4. Assess library completeness vs user domain requirements
5. Report library quality and scalability gaps

### Agent 10: rules/ System Integration
**Task**: Validate rules/ directory integration with core system
1. Read rules/conditional-loading-protocols.md
2. Validate conditional loading implementation
3. Check rules integration with docs/core/ authority
4. Assess rule activation and context-based loading
5. Report integration and activation deficiencies

### Agent 11: tools/ Development Support
**Task**: Validate tools/ directory development support effectiveness
1. Sample 3-5 template files for quality assessment
2. Validate template integration with command development
3. Check tools effectiveness for user workflow support
4. Assess development utility completeness
5. Report development tool and template deficiencies

### Agent 12: Cross-System Integration Audit
**Task**: Comprehensive cross-system integration and user requirement compliance
1. Validate Think√ó4 methodology integration system-wide
2. Validate Sacred User Space authority preservation
3. Check end-to-end workflow compliance
4. Assess overall system coherence vs user vision
5. Report critical system gaps and integration deficiencies

## Success Metrics
- Individual Agent Reporting: Each agent provides specific scores and recommendations
- Cross-System Validation: Integration health across all components  
- User Requirement Compliance: Alignment with Sacred User Space authority
