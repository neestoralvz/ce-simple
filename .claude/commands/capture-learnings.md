# Capture-Learnings - Intelligent Post-Execution Learning System

## 🎯 Purpose
Dual-phase learning capture: automatic pattern documentation during workflows and intelligent post-execution interviews based on learning value assessment.

## 🚀 Usage
**Auto-Triggered**: Activates automatically during analysis phase and post-execution
**Manual**: Execute `/capture-learnings [phase: process|results]`

## 🔧 Implementation

### Behavioral Reinforcement Protocol
**MANDATORY at learning capture initialization**:

```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "📊 SCORING: Calculate learning value using intelligent assessment framework (≥4 points threshold)", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "learn-score-1"},
  {"content": "🎤 INTERVIEW: Conduct dynamic user interview via intelligent question generation", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "learn-interview-1"},
  {"content": "📝 PATTERNS: Document discovered patterns with evidence-based analysis", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "learn-patterns-1"},
  {"content": "🔄 ORCHESTRATION: Coordinate learning capture via /agent-orchestration for efficiency", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "learn-orchestration-1"},
  {"content": "🔧 INTEGRITY: Execute /matrix-maintenance validation for system coherence", "status": "pending", "priority": "low", "id": "learn-integrity-1"},
  {"content": "🎯 EVOLUTION: Update command network based on learning patterns and insights", "status": "pending", "priority": "low", "id": "learn-evolution-1"}
])
```

**Intelligence-Driven Todos**: Add conditional todos based on learning value threshold and interview outcomes

### Structural Validation Protocol
**PRE-EXECUTION**:
1. 🏗️ **STRUCTURE**: Validate organization compliance
2. 🔗 **REFERENCES**: Check cross-reference integrity  
3. 📏 **SIZE**: Ensure context/ files within limits
4. ⚡ **CORRECT**: Fix structural violations

**Pattern Evolution**: Detect successful patterns → Update standards → Optimize structure → Maintain integrity

### Dual-Phase Learning Architecture

#### Phase 1: Process Learning (Auto-Capture During Execution)
**Activation**: Parallel deployment during `/explore-codebase`, `/think-layers`, and complex analysis workflows
**Coordination**: Via `/agent-orchestration` for non-intrusive pattern detection
**Capture Scope**:
- **Architectural Decisions**: Document design choices and rationale during execution
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify emerging patterns and successful approaches
- **Problem Resolution**: Record solution strategies and decision points
- **Alternative Evaluation**: Track considered approaches and selection criteria

#### Phase 2: Results Learning (Intelligent Post-Execution Assessment)
**Learning Value Scoring Framework**:
```
📊 COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT:
• Progressive disclosure mastery (+2 points)
• System health optimization (+2 points)
• Alternative strategies evaluated (+1 point)
• Cross-domain insights generated (+1 point)
• Workflow complexity indicators (+1 point)

🎯 THRESHOLD EVALUATION: ≥4 points → Interview activation
🎤 DYNAMIC INTERVIEW: 3-6 context-driven questions in Spanish
```

#### Integration & Validation Protocol
**Contextual Validation**: Workflow-aware focus on just-executed commands and patterns
**Learning Enhancement**: Interview insights inform system improvement priorities
**Pattern Documentation**: Systematic capture in context/ directories with structured organization
**System Evolution**: Learning patterns influence future workflow optimization and command enhancement

### Learning Quality Assurance & Documentation Framework

#### Evidence-Based Documentation Standards
**Anti-Bias Processing**: Neutral observation documentation with evidence-based conclusions only
**Progressive Disclosure**: Context file appending with size limits (≤200 lines maximum)
**Pattern Validation**: Multi-execution validation for evidence-based pattern identification
**Cross-Reference Integrity**: Systematic validation via `/matrix-maintenance` integration

#### Intelligent Documentation Organization
**File Placement Strategy**:
- `context/experience/session-[timestamp].md` → User interview responses and insights
- `context/patterns/learning-[domain].md` → Documented patterns and approaches
- `context/discoveries/workflow-[session].md` → Process learning and decision documentation

#### System Integrity Validation Framework
**Activation Protocol**: When interview threshold (≥4 points) exceeded
**Validation Scope**: Command system coherence at maximum learning context
**Gap Discovery**: Reference integrity, missing connections, resolution recommendations
**Enhancement Integration**: Learning insights inform gap priority assessment and system evolution

### Notification Integration

#### Process Learning Notifications
```
🧠 LEARNING: Pattern detection active → [discovery-type] identified
📚 CAPTURE: Decision documented → [pattern-category] updated  
🔗 INTEGRATION: Context enhanced → [context-file] enriched
```

#### Results Learning Notifications  
```
🎯 ASSESSMENT: Interview necessity evaluated → [score]/10 points
📊 DECISION: User interview activated → [question-count] dynamic questions
🔍 INTEGRITY: System validation initiated → [X] commands from executed workflow
⚠️  GAPS: [N] system gaps discovered → [priority breakdown]
✅ COMPLETION: Learning + validation captured → [pattern-count] patterns enhanced
🚫 SKIP: Auto-documentation → Low learning value detected
```
