# Think Layers - Progressive Analysis Framework

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Execute progressive cognitive analysis through structured thinking layers: Think â†’ Think-Hard â†’ Think-Harder â†’ Ultra-Think for comprehensive problem solving.

## ðŸš€ Usage
Execute: `/think-layers [analysis-target] [starting-layer]`

## ðŸ”§ Implementation

### Progressive Analysis Protocol
**Auto-Depth Selection**: System determines required thinking depth based on complexity scoring
**Cognitive Escalation**: Systematic analysis depth increase with load management
**Integration Cascade**: Build insights across all thinking levels with validation
**Plan Consolidation**: Convert analysis into implementable steps with agent delegation

### Four-Layer Framework
**Layer 1**: Think (25% load, 2-5min) - Surface patterns and basic understanding
**Layer 2**: Think-Hard (50% load, 5-15min) - Component analysis and relationships  
**Layer 3**: Think-Harder (75% load, 15-30min) - Systems integration and strategies
**Layer 4**: Ultra-Think (95% load, 30-60min) - Meta-analysis and innovation

### Auto-Activation System
**Complexity Matrix**:
- Score 1-3: Simple â†’ Layer 1-2
- Score 4-6: Moderate â†’ Layer 2-3  
- Score 7-8: High â†’ Layer 1-4
- Score 9-10: Maximum â†’ Full 4-layer analysis

**Dynamic Escalation**: Auto-escalate when contradictions, complexity emergence, or solution inadequacy detected

### Plan Consolidation Framework
**AUTO-TRIGGER**: After synthesis completion â†’ Intelligent task division
**Context Consolidation**: Aggregate discoveries from parallel analysis agents when triggered by `/start`
**Documentation Detection**: Automatic classification of documentation tasks (README, API docs, guides, .md files)
**Agent Delegation**: Deploy independent docs-agent for `/docs-workflow` with structured todo plans
**Parallel Execution**: Documentation workflow + main implementation workflow coordination

*Context consolidation protocols and implementation details in `../../standards/think-layers-implementation.md`*

## âš¡ Triggers

### Input Triggers
**Context**: Complex analysis or synthesis required following discovery phases
**Previous**: `/explore-codebase` or `/explore-web` with discovered patterns requiring analysis
**Keywords**: analyze, think, understand, synthesize, evaluate, assess

### Output Triggers
**Success**: Analysis complete â†’ Plan consolidation and intelligent agent delegation
**Documentation**: Tasks detected â†’ Independent `/docs-workflow` execution with todo plans
**Implementation**: Roadmap ready â†’ Main workflow execution coordination
**Chain**: think-layers â†’ {docs-agent + main-execution} â†’ capture-learnings

### Success Patterns
**Analysis Success**: Clear understanding achieved â†’ Plan consolidation triggered
**Synthesis Success**: Implementation roadmap generated â†’ Task division executed  
**Delegation Success**: Documentation + execution tasks â†’ Parallel workflow coordination
**Integration Success**: Multi-agent workflows â†’ Combined execution readiness

### Automatic Learning Capture Integration
**POST-ANALYSIS ASSESSMENT**: After analysis completion, evaluate session learning value and auto-trigger capture when warranted

**Learning Value Auto-Detection**:
```
ðŸ“Š ANALYSIS-SCORING: Calculate cognitive complexity and pattern discovery value
ðŸ§  COMPLEXITY-INDICATORS:
  - Multiple thinking layers activated (+2 points)
  - Novel pattern synthesis achieved (+2 points)
  - Error resolution during analysis (+2 points)
  - Alternative strategies evaluated (+1 point)
  - Cross-domain insights generated (+1 point)

ðŸŽ¯ AUTO-THRESHOLD: â‰¥4 points â†’ Automatic /capture-learnings activation
âš¡ EXECUTION: Seamless transition from analysis â†’ learning documentation
```

**Integration Protocol**:
1. **Analysis Complete** â†’ Evaluate session complexity using learning scoring framework
2. **Threshold Check** â†’ Compare against â‰¥4 point learning value requirement
3. **Auto-Trigger** â†’ Execute /capture-learnings with analysis context when threshold met
4. **Pattern Documentation** â†’ Capture analysis insights and decision patterns automatically
5. **System Learning** â†’ Integrate discoveries into context architecture for future analysis enhancement
