# Cross-System Coordination Master

**Command**: `/start-coordination-master`  
**Type**: Master conversation orchestrator  
**Purpose**: Integrate results from all 5 validation conversations with 8 parallel sub-agents  
**Authority**: Master coordination hub for user-input validation ultra project

## Command: /start-coordination-master

Deploy 8 parallel sub-agents via Task Tool to integrate results from all 5 validation conversations, resolve conflicts, build priority matrix, generate master coherence report, and create final implementation roadmap.

## Master Coordination Logic

**Phase 1**: Deploy 8 Parallel Sub-Agents via Task Tool
**Phase 2**: Cross-Conversation Synchronization  
**Phase 3**: Master Dashboard Compilation
**Phase 4**: Final Integration and Delivery
