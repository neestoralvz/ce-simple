# /template-command - Command Template System

## Purpose
Provides standard template for creating new commands with 4-section structure ensuring consistency, self-containment, and parallel orchestration optimization.

## Principles and Guidelines
- **4-Section Structure**: Purpose, Principles and Guidelines, Execution Process, Single Responsibility
- **Verbo-Sustantivo Naming**: Apply verb-noun pattern for command names ensuring clarity
- **Self-Contained Design**: Embed complete execution requirements without external dependencies
- **Parallel Optimization**: Design for concurrent execution using Task Tool orchestration

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Template Structure Application
Update TodoWrite mark "command template application" as in_progress

Apply standard 4-section template structure:
- Implement Purpose section with single-line function description
- Apply Principles and Guidelines with 4 standardized bullets
- Structure Execution Process with 4 phases including TodoWrite integration
- Add Single Responsibility footer statement

### Phase 2: Implementation Design & Orchestration
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "implementation design" as in_progress

Design command implementation using orchestration patterns:
- Select parallel, sequential, or hybrid orchestration strategy
- Define context requirements specifying necessary information types
- Plan 4-phase task breakdown with Discovery, Analysis, Execution, Completion
- Integrate TodoWrite behavioral reinforcement throughout phases

### Phase 3: Standards Compliance & Validation
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "standards compliance validation" as in_progress

Ensure template compliance using validation protocols:
- Verify ≤150 lines total command length
- Validate ≤15 words per instruction requirement
- Check natural language instruction formatting
- Confirm absolute file path usage in outputs

### Phase 4: Documentation & Usage Examples
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "template documentation" as in_progress

Document template usage with comprehensive examples:
- Create basic command structure demonstration
- Provide naming convention guidelines with examples
- Document structure requirements and content standards
- Generate template validation checklist for quality assurance

Update TodoWrite complete all template command tasks

**Error Handling**: Identify template structure violations with correction guidance, validate naming convention compliance, ensure standards requirement adherence, provide systematic template improvement recommendations

**Single Responsibility**: Command template provision through standardized 4-section structure, orchestration patterns, standards compliance, and validation ensuring consistent command development across system.
