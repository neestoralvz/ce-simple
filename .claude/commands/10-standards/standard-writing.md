# /standard-writing - Writing Standards System

## Purpose
Establishes standardized writing guidelines for natural language instructions and documentation ensuring Claude Code execution clarity through concise, actionable communication.

## Principles and Guidelines
- **≤15 Words Rule**: Maintain concise, actionable instructions eliminating unnecessary verbosity
- **Natural Language**: Write direct, imperative language for immediate Claude Code comprehension
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Structure content from overview to implementation to reference details
- **Active Voice**: Use consistent active construction avoiding passive language patterns

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Instruction Writing Standards
Update TodoWrite mark "instruction writing standards" as in_progress

Establish concise instruction patterns using action-oriented structure:
- Apply Action + Target + Context format for clarity
- Implement ≤15 words per instruction guideline
- Use direct, imperative language avoiding uncertainty
- Eliminate filler words and redundant phrases consistently

### Phase 2: Documentation Structure Standards
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "documentation structure standards" as in_progress

Apply progressive disclosure principles using hierarchical organization:
- Implement H1-H4 heading hierarchy for consistent navigation
- Apply purpose statement, quick start, implementation, reference flow
- Use parallel structure maintaining consistent phrasing patterns
- Enforce active voice construction eliminating passive language

### Phase 3: Command Writing & Error Prevention
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "command writing standards" as in_progress

Establish command instruction standards using error prevention protocols:
- Write direct commands as Claude Code instructions
- Specify absolute file paths preventing relative path errors
- Distinguish required vs optional parameters clearly
- Apply specific parameter documentation eliminating ambiguity

### Phase 4: Validation & Compliance Documentation
Update TodoWrite complete previous, mark "writing validation documentation" as in_progress

Document writing standards with validation examples:
- Create writing standards validation checklist
- Provide effective vs ineffective instruction examples
- Document progressive disclosure implementation patterns
- Generate writing standards compliance verification protocol

Update TodoWrite complete all writing standards tasks

**Error Handling**: Identify verbose instruction patterns with ≤15 word corrections, flag passive voice construction suggesting active alternatives, document unclear parameter specifications, provide systematic writing improvement guidance

**Single Responsibility**: Writing standards establishment through concise instruction guidelines, progressive disclosure principles, active voice enforcement, and error prevention ensuring clear Claude Code communication.
