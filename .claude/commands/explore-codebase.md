# Explore Codebase - Internal Knowledge Discovery

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Systematically explore and analyze codebase structure, patterns, and implementation details using parallel Task Tool operations for maximum efficiency.

## ðŸš€ Usage
Execute: `/explore-codebase [search-target] [depth-level]`

## ðŸ”§ Implementation

### Exploration Protocol
**MANDATORY**: Deploy multiple Task Tools for parallel analysis and maximum efficiency
**Anti-Bias Discovery**: NO predetermined assumptions about codebase structure - patterns emerge from evidence
**Context Integration**: Consolidate findings from all parallel tasks into structured context files

### Parallel Task Orchestration
**Task 1**: Structure mapping - Directory hierarchy and file organization analysis
**Task 2**: Pattern identification - Framework, library, and coding pattern detection
**Task 3**: Dependency resolution - Import/export and component relationship mapping
**Task 4**: Configuration analysis - Environment and build setup understanding

### Search Strategy Framework
**Targeted Exploration**: Specific function/class/config/test pattern searches
**Comprehensive Exploration**: Complete architecture, tech stack, and integration analysis
**Evidence-Based Discovery**: All conclusions based on discovered code evidence
**70-80% Efficiency**: Parallel task deployment reduces exploration time significantly

### Context Generation System
**File Organization**: Structured output to context/discoveries/, context/patterns/, context/research/
**Content Standards**: Maximum information density with hierarchical organization
**Cross-References**: Actionable findings with direct implementation translation
**Result Consolidation**: Integrate all parallel task results into coherent narrative

## âš¡ Triggers

### Input Triggers
**Context**: Complex codebase analysis required following discovery initiation
**Previous**: `/start` exploration phase or direct codebase analysis requirement
**Keywords**: codebase, structure, patterns, architecture, implementation

### Output Triggers  
**Success**: Exploration complete â†’ `/think-layers` for pattern analysis and synthesis
**Validation**: Specific patterns found â†’ `/explore-web` for external research confirmation
**Integration**: All components understood â†’ Implementation planning readiness
**Chain**: explore-codebase â†’ think-layers â†’ execution workflow

### Success Patterns
**Discovery Success**: >85% codebase structure mapped â†’ Analysis pipeline triggered
**Pattern Success**: Clear architectural patterns identified â†’ Recommendation generation
**Integration Success**: All components understood â†’ Implementation workflow ready
