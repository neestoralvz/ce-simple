# analyze-parallel

## Purpose

Executes intelligent codebase analysis for parallelization opportunities through pattern detection providing measurable performance improvements with implementation recommendations and validation protocols.

## Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Focus on parallel analysis without optimization implementation
- **Granular Approach**: Break codebase examination into concurrent scanning with clear phases
- **Resource Management**: Handle baseline metrics with explicit optimization requirements
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in fallback scanning methods and validation protocols

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Discovery Pattern Scanning
Mark "Discovery and Pattern Scanning" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute codebase scanning:
- Scan target directory using file discovery patterns
- Detect blocking operations and performance constraints
- Establish performance baseline metrics and utilization measurements
- Identify parallelizable pattern opportunities through analysis

Use Glob to discover files:
- File discovery achieving pattern identification
- Baseline establishment with utilization measurements

If pattern detection failures occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve detection error: alternative methods"
- Execute retry with alternative analysis methods for flows
- Validate detection completeness ensuring pattern coverage
- Continue with validated scanning results

Complete previous phase, mark "Dependency Analysis and Assessment" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 2: Dependency Analysis
Mark "Dependency Analysis and Assessment" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute dependency mapping:
- Map operation dependencies and execution chains
- Evaluate processing capacity and utilization metrics
- Analyze resource constraints and performance bottlenecks
- Assess optimization potential from discovered patterns

Use Grep to map dependencies:
- Dependency mapping achieving execution chain analysis
- Resource evaluation with constraint analysis

If resource evaluation issues occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve evaluation error: conservative estimates"
- Execute conservative estimates for uncertain calculations
- Validate evaluation accuracy ensuring optimization potential
- Continue with validated resource assessment

Complete previous phase, mark "Optimization Scoring and Ranking" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 3: Optimization Scoring
Mark "Optimization Scoring and Ranking" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute scoring calculation:
- Score optimization opportunities using impact metrics
- Rank parallelization candidates by improvement projections
- Calculate expected speedup factors and efficiency gains
- Generate ranking results based on measurable improvements

Use Bash to calculate scoring:
- Scoring calculation achieving impact assessment
- Ranking generation with efficiency analysis

If scoring calculation errors occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve scoring error: validation protocols"
- Execute comprehensive validation protocols for opportunities
- Validate scoring accuracy ensuring ranking reliability
- Continue with validated optimization scores

Complete previous phase, mark "Recommendation Synthesis and Validation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 4: Recommendation Synthesis
Mark "Recommendation Synthesis and Validation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute strategy generation:
- Synthesize implementation recommendations with optimization strategies
- Generate performance projections and validation protocols
- Create implementation roadmap with priority ordering
- Provide resource requirements for each opportunity

Use Write to synthesize recommendations:
- Strategy generation achieving implementation guidance
- Performance projection with validation protocols

If synthesis validation issues occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve synthesis error: comprehensive validation"
- Execute comprehensive validation for implementation strategies
- Validate synthesis completeness ensuring actionable guidance
- Complete analysis with validated optimization recommendations

Complete all tasks using TodoWrite
