# complexity-assess

## Purpose

Executes embedded complexity calculations with precision providing agent workload assessment and deployment strategy determination through mathematical analysis.

## Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Focus on mathematical calculations without deployment execution
- **Granular Approach**: Break assessment into precise calculation steps with clear validation
- **Resource Management**: Handle precision requirements with explicit validation protocols
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in calculation error handling and validation protocols

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Parameter Validation
Mark "Complexity calculation parameter validation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute input validation:
- Check workload parameter is numeric within range
- Verify dependencies parameter is numeric and valid
- Confirm constraints parameter is numeric and appropriate
- Validate parameters are properly formatted for calculation

Use Bash to validate parameters:
- Parameter validation achieving range verification
- Environment preparation with precision setup

If invalid inputs occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve input error: boundary validation"
- Execute boundary condition validation with error handling
- Validate input restoration ensuring calculation capability
- Continue with validated parameter set

Complete previous phase, mark "Agent complexity calculation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 2: Complexity Calculation
Mark "Agent complexity calculation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute mathematical assessment:
- Calculate complexity using embedded formula with precision
- Verify complexity score has required decimal precision
- Check result is within expected calculation range
- Confirm calculation accuracy with validation cases

Use Bash to calculate complexity:
- Mathematical assessment achieving precision calculation
- Result validation with accuracy confirmation

If calculation errors occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve calculation error: fallback defaults"
- Execute fallback calculation with safe defaults
- Validate calculation restoration ensuring accuracy
- Continue with validated complexity score

Complete previous phase, mark "Deployment strategy determination" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 3: Strategy Determination
Mark "Deployment strategy determination" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute strategy decision:
- Determine deployment strategy based on complexity thresholds
- Verify threshold boundaries are correctly applied
- Check strategy matches complexity score range
- Confirm threshold logic is properly implemented

Use Bash to determine strategy:
- Strategy decision achieving threshold classification
- Boundary validation with logic confirmation

If threshold errors occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve threshold error: edge case validation"
- Execute edge case validation at boundary values
- Validate threshold accuracy ensuring strategy reliability
- Continue with validated strategy determination

Complete previous phase, mark "Calculation result validation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 4: Result Validation
Mark "Calculation result validation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute final validation:
- Verify precision in complexity score formatting
- Confirm strategy recommendation matches calculated score
- Check threshold classification is accurate
- Validate all calculations are consistent

Use Write to generate report:
- Report generation achieving standardized assessment
- Documentation creation with validation status

If validation inconsistencies occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve validation error: consistency check"
- Execute comprehensive consistency validation for calculations
- Validate assessment completeness ensuring deployment readiness
- Complete calculation with validated complexity assessment

Complete all tasks using TodoWrite
