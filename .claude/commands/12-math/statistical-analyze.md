# /statistical-analyze - Statistical Analysis & Pattern Detection

## Purpose
Executes comprehensive statistical analysis and pattern detection with confidence intervals providing rigorous mathematical foundation for data-driven insights and predictive assessments.

## Principles and Guidelines
- **Statistical Rigor**: Apply advanced statistical methods with proper significance testing
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify complex patterns using mathematical analysis techniques
- **Confidence Assessment**: Provide confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification
- **Cross-Domain Integration**: Support analysis across all ce-simple categories with mathematical backing

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Data Preparation and Exploratory Analysis
Update TodoWrite: Mark "statistical data preparation" as in_progress

Execute comprehensive data collection and preprocessing using Read, Bash, and Grep:
- Collect multi-dimensional datasets from system operations and performance logs
- Perform data quality assessment with missing value analysis and outlier detection using Z-score method
- Execute distribution analysis and normality testing with mathematical validation
- Validate data completeness with statistical preprocessing

Use Bash for statistical preprocessing:
```bash
# Statistical data preparation with outlier removal
awk '{sum += $1; sumsq += $1^2; data[NR] = $1} END {
    mean = sum/NR; variance = (sumsq - sum^2/NR)/(NR-1); stddev = sqrt(variance)
    for(i=1; i<=NR; i++) {
        zscore = (data[i] - mean) / stddev
        if(zscore > -3.0 && zscore < 3.0) print data[i]
    }
}' dataset.txt > clean_data.txt
```

### Phase 2: Advanced Statistical Analysis
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "advanced statistical computation" as in_progress

Execute mathematical statistical analysis using Task and Bash:
- Perform hypothesis testing with appropriate statistical tests and significance levels
- Calculate correlation matrices for multi-variable relationships using Pearson coefficients
- Execute regression analysis for predictive modeling with R-squared validation
- Apply time series analysis for temporal pattern detection with autocorrelation

Use Bash for correlation analysis:
```bash
# Pearson correlation coefficient with significance testing
paste dataset_x.txt dataset_y.txt | awk '{
    n++; sumx += $1; sumy += $2; sumxy += $1*$2; sumx2 += $1^2; sumy2 += $2^2
} END {
    meanx = sumx/n; meany = sumy/n
    correlation = (sumxy - n*meanx*meany) / sqrt((sumx2 - n*meanx^2) * (sumy2 - n*meany^2))
    t_stat = correlation * sqrt((n-2)/(1-correlation^2))
    printf "CORRELATION: %.4f\nT_STATISTIC: %.4f\nSIGNIFICANCE: %s\n", 
           correlation, t_stat, (t_stat > 1.96) ? "SIGNIFICANT" : "NOT_SIGNIFICANT"
}'
```

### Phase 3: Pattern Detection and Classification
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "pattern detection analysis" as in_progress

Execute pattern recognition using mathematical algorithms:
- Apply clustering analysis for pattern grouping with distance-based methods
- Perform trend detection using regression techniques and moving averages
- Execute seasonal decomposition for cyclical patterns with mathematical validation
- Analyze pattern significance using statistical validation and confidence assessment

Use Task for advanced pattern detection with mathematical clustering and trend analysis algorithms.

### Phase 4: Confidence Interval and Statistical Validation
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "statistical validation analysis" as in_progress

Execute confidence assessment using mathematical methods:
- Calculate confidence intervals using appropriate statistical distributions
- Perform statistical significance testing with hypothesis validation
- Execute model diagnostic tests for assumption validation
- Generate uncertainty quantification with mathematical bounds

Use Bash for confidence interval calculation:
```bash
# Confidence interval calculation with statistical validation
mean=$(awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum/NR}' dataset.txt)
stddev=$(awk -v mean="$mean" '{sum+=($1-mean)^2} END {print sqrt(sum/(NR-1))}' dataset.txt)
n=$(wc -l < dataset.txt)
margin=$(echo "scale=4; 1.96 * $stddev / sqrt($n)" | bc)
lower=$(echo "scale=4; $mean - $margin" | bc)
upper=$(echo "scale=4; $mean + $margin" | bc)
echo "CONFIDENCE_INTERVAL: [$lower, $upper]"
echo "MARGIN_ERROR: $margin"
```

### Phase 5: Statistical Report Generation
Update TodoWrite: Complete previous, mark "statistical analysis reporting" as in_progress

Generate comprehensive statistical analysis report using Write and Task:
- Document statistical analysis results with mathematical validation and significance testing
- Report pattern detection findings with confidence measures and statistical backing
- Include correlation analysis with significance assessment and relationship strength
- Provide statistical recommendations based on rigorous mathematical analysis

Use Write for standardized statistical report generation with mathematical rigor and cross-category integration support.
