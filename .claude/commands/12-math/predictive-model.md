    local raw_data="$1"
    sort -k1,1n "$raw_data" | awk '!seen[$1]++' | awk '{
        values[NR % 5] = $2
        if(NR >= 5) {
            ma_sum = 0; for(i=0; i<5; i++) ma_sum += values[i]
            moving_avg = ma_sum / 5
            first_diff = (NR > 1) ? $2 - prev_value : 0
            printf "%s %.4f %.4f %.4f\n", $1, $2, moving_avg, first_diff
        }
        prev_value = $2
    }'
}
```

### Phase 2: Mathematical Model Selection and Training

        slope = (n*sumxy - sumx*sumy)/(n*sumx2 - sumx^2)
        intercept = (sumy - slope*sumx)/n
        # Calculate R-squared for model validation
        for(i=1; i<=n; i++) {
            predicted = intercept + slope*i
            rss += (data[i] - predicted)^2

        }
        r_squared = 1 - rss/tss
        printf "SLOPE: %.6f\nINTERCEPT: %.6f\nR_SQUARED: %.4f\n", slope, intercept, r_squared
    }' "$dataset"
}

# Exponential smoothing with mathematical optimization
fit_exponential_smoothing() {

        smoothed = (NR == 1) ? $2 : alpha * $2 + (1 - alpha) * smoothed
        if(NR > 1) mse += ($2 - prev_forecast)^2
        prev_forecast = smoothed
    } END {

        abs_error = (error < 0) ? -error : error
        pct_error = (actual != 0) ? (abs_error / actual) * 100 : 0
        sum_abs_error += abs_error; sum_pct_error += pct_error
        sum_squared_error += error^2; sum_actual += actual; sum_forecast += forecast
