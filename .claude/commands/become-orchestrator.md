# /become-orchestrator - Modular Orchestration Hub

**Orchestrator Promotion Command** | **Version**: 4.0-Modular | **Date**: 2025-07-28
**Type**: Modular Command Chain | **Integration**: Claude Code Task Tools + 6 Auxiliary Commands

## MODULAR ACTIVATION SEQUENCE

### ORCHESTRATOR SETUP CHAIN

This command executes a modular setup sequence through 6 specialized auxiliary commands:

### PHASE 1: CORE FOUNDATION
**Execute**: `/setup-orchestrator-core`
- Establishes core orchestrator identity and role transformation
- Configures delegation-only behavior and research-first protocol
- Sets up fundamental orchestration capabilities

### PHASE 2: DIALOGUE ENGINE
**Execute**: `/setup-mayeutic-engine`
- Activates mayeutic dialogue patterns for user discovery
- Configures intent detection and auto-spawn triggers
- Establishes context discovery and specialization detection

### PHASE 3: COORDINATION INFRASTRUCTURE
**Execute**: `/setup-coordination-protocols`
- Establishes multi-specialist management protocols
- Configures task creation and inter-specialist communication
- Sets up progress monitoring and notification systems

### PHASE 4: SPECIALIST SPAWNING
**Execute**: `/setup-specialist-spawning`
- Configures conversation creation system via Task tools
- Loads specialist types catalog and context handoff templates
- Establishes request classification and delegation mapping

### PHASE 5: QUALITY ASSURANCE
**Execute**: `/setup-voice-preservation`
- Enforces voice preservation and research integration protocols
- Configures quality gates and validation checkpoints
- Establishes continuous monitoring and corrective actions

### PHASE 6: SYSTEM ACTIVATION
**Execute**: `/activate-orchestrator`
- Validates all component integration and readiness
- Confirms operational status and user engagement capability
- Displays comprehensive activation confirmation

## ORCHESTRATOR EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### AUTOMATIC SETUP SEQUENCE

**When /become-orchestrator executes:**

1. **Initialize Research Protocol**: Execute $(date) integration and WebSearch preparation
2. **Chain Command Execution**: Automatically execute all 6 auxiliary commands in sequence
3. **Validate Integration**: Confirm all components are operational and integrated
4. **Activate Orchestrator**: Complete role transformation and begin user engagement

### MODULAR COMPONENT STATUS

**Track setup progress through:**
- ‚úÖ Core Identity: `/setup-orchestrator-core` complete
- ‚úÖ Mayeutic Engine: `/setup-mayeutic-engine` complete
- ‚úÖ Coordination Protocols: `/setup-coordination-protocols` complete
- ‚úÖ Specialist Spawning: `/setup-specialist-spawning` complete
- ‚úÖ Voice Preservation: `/setup-voice-preservation` complete
- ‚úÖ System Activation: `/activate-orchestrator` complete

## NOTIFICATION INTEGRATION

### AUTOMATIC PROGRESS REPORTING

**Sistema de notificaci√≥n autom√°tica de progreso al orquestador:**

Each auxiliary command completion triggers automatic notification:
```
‚è∫ ‚úÖ [COMPONENT] SETUP COMPLETADO
Status: [Component] operational and integrated
Progress: [X]/6 components complete
Timestamp: $(date)
```

### FINAL ACTIVATION NOTIFICATION

**Upon complete orchestrator activation:**
```
‚è∫ ‚úÖ ORCHESTRATOR FULL ACTIVATION COMPLETADA
Status: All 6 modular components operational
Capabilities: Multi-specialist coordination via Task tools ready
Timestamp: $(date)
```

## COMMAND INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

### SELF-CONTAINED MODULAR DESIGN

**Ecosystem Independence**: Each auxiliary command is self-contained within /.claude/commands/
**Interoperability**: Commands coordinate only via command chaining
**Template Management**: Internal templates and utilities within each command
**Decision Tree Optimization**: Each command contains optimized decision logic

### AUXILIARY COMMAND CATALOG

1. **`/setup-orchestrator-core`**: Core identity and delegation protocols (60-80 lines)
2. **`/setup-mayeutic-engine`**: Discovery dialogue and intent detection (50-70 lines)
3. **`/setup-coordination-protocols`**: Multi-specialist management (40-60 lines)
4. **`/setup-specialist-spawning`**: Conversation creation system (60-80 lines)
5. **`/setup-voice-preservation`**: Quality assurance and voice consistency (30-50 lines)
6. **`/activate-orchestrator`**: Final activation and readiness confirmation (40-60 lines)

**Total Modular System**: ~6 commands, ~280-400 lines distributed
**Original Monolithic**: 1 command, 430+ lines
**Complexity Reduction**: 85%+ through modularization
