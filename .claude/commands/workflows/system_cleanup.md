# /workflows:system_cleanup - Vision-Driven Complexity Management

**30/07/2025 08:20 CDMX** | Automated cleanup of architectural bloat that doesn't serve vision

## Command Purpose
Automatically detect and eliminate architectural complexity that doesn't serve discovered vision. Uses conversation to validate eliminations before execution.

**LOAD:** VISION.md + system_evolution/complexity_management/

## Core Philosophy
**"Hacerlo lo que tiene que ser"** - eliminate what doesn't serve vision, preserve what does

## Auto-Detection Protocol

### Complexity Metrics Analysis
**System analyzes current state:**
- File count growth patterns (currently 197 files)
- Reference chain complexity (how many hops to reach actual content)
- Architectural overhead ratio (structure files vs functional files)
- Token economy efficiency (context loading cost vs value delivered)

### Vision Alignment Assessment
**For each component, evaluate:**
- Does this serve a principle in VISION.md?
- Does this support essential workflows?
- Does this add value to user experience?
- Would elimination improve or degrade vision fulfillment?

### User Conversation Integration
**Before any elimination:**
- Present findings to user with specific examples
- Ask vision-based questions: "¿Este componente sirve tu visión actual?"
- Propose consolidation options with clear trade-offs
- Validate elimination decisions through dialogue

## Cleanup Execution Strategy

### Safe Elimination Approach
1. **Identify removal candidates** based on vision alignment
2. **Present to user** with clear reasoning and impact assessment
3. **Get explicit approval** for each elimination decision
4. **Create backup** of eliminated content in dated archive
5. **Execute elimination** with rollback capability
6. **Validate system functionality** post-cleanup

### Content Consolidation Protocol
**Instead of elimination, when appropriate:**
- Merge fragmented files that serve same vision purpose
- Consolidate scattered wisdom into accessible formats
- Combine reference-only files with actual content
- Simplify navigation without losing essential information

## Vision-Driven Decision Framework

### Keep Criteria
- **Essential workflows** that user actually uses
- **Core vision principles** that guide decisions
- **Active project context** that serves current work
- **Functional templates** that accelerate work

### Eliminate Criteria  
- **Architectural abstractions** without clear functional benefit
- **Reference-only chains** that complicate navigation
- **Theoretical frameworks** unused in practice
- **Over-engineered modularity** that creates confusion

### Consolidate Criteria
- **Fragmented content** serving same purpose
- **Scattered wisdom** that should be accessible
- **Multiple files** with overlapping function
- **Complex hierarchies** that can be flattened

## Integration with Vision Evolution

### Vision Change Triggers
- When VISION.md evolves, automatically reassess system alignment
- New vision principles may require different architectural support
- Eliminated complexity may need restoration if vision changes
- System adapts structure to serve evolved vision

### Continuous Cleanup Protocol
- Regular vision alignment assessments
- Proactive complexity detection before it becomes overhead
- User dialogue integration for ongoing cleanup decisions
- Evolution-aware cleanup that preserves adaptation capability

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Targets
- File count reduction while preserving essential function
- Improved navigation clarity (fewer clicks to reach resources)
- Token economy optimization (faster context loading)
- Reduced cognitive load for system usage

### Qualitative Validation
- User can find needed resources intuitively
- System feels simpler without losing capability
- Vision implementation becomes more straightforward
- Architectural overhead eliminated without functional loss

## Usage Pattern
```
/workflows:system_cleanup
→ System analyzes current complexity
→ Presents elimination candidates with reasoning
→ User validates decisions through conversation
→ Executes approved cleanup with safety measures
→ Validates system functionality post-cleanup
```

## Anti-Pattern Prevention
- **Aggressive elimination** without user validation
- **Architecture-driven decisions** instead of vision-driven
- **Static cleanup criteria** that don't evolve with vision
- **Irreversible changes** without backup/rollback capability
