# /workflows:discovery_navigation - Conversational System Discovery

**30/07/2025 11:15 CDMX** | Natural conversation-based system navigation

## Command Purpose
Enable users to discover system capabilities through natural conversation rather than reading documentation. System reveals functionality organically through dialogue.

**LOAD:** VISION.md + context/operational/patterns/socratic_methodology.md

## Core Philosophy
**"El sistema se descubre a sí mismo a través de conversación natural, no de documentación"**

## Discovery Protocol

### Conversational Entry Points
**Natural conversation starters that reveal system capabilities:**
- "¿Qué puedes hacer?"
- "Necesito ayuda con..."
- "¿Cómo empiezo?"
- "¿Qué opciones tengo?"

### Organic Capability Revelation
**System reveals functionality based on user context:**
- Detect user intent through conversation
- Propose relevant capabilities based on detected needs
- Demonstrate functionality through natural examples
- Guide discovery through questions rather than lists

### Context-Aware Suggestions
**Adapt suggestions to current state:**
- Analyze project status and suggest next logical steps
- Propose workflows based on current vision state
- Recommend commands based on detected patterns
- Offer relevant integrations based on user ecosystem

## Discovery Flow Patterns

### Progressive Disclosure
**Reveal complexity gradually through conversation:**
1. **Basic capability** - Simple, immediate options
2. **Contextual depth** - Relevant advanced features when appropriate
3. **Integration possibilities** - Cross-workflow connections when valuable
4. **Customization options** - Adaptation capabilities when needed

### Question-Driven Navigation
**Use questions to guide discovery:**
- "¿Estás empezando un proyecto nuevo o continuando uno existente?"
- "¿Tu vision está clara o necesitas explorarla?"
- "¿Prefieres building directo o setup sistemático primero?"
- "¿Necesitas ayuda con organization o con implementation?"

### Adaptive Response Patterns
**System adapts explanations to user sophistication:**
- Detect user familiarity with system concepts
- Adjust explanation depth based on user responses
- Evolve interaction style based on user preferences
- Learn user patterns and adapt suggestions accordingly

## Natural Documentation Integration

### Conversational Examples Over Lists
**Show don't tell approach:**
- Demonstrate workflows through natural conversation examples
- Use actual user scenarios rather than abstract descriptions
- Show integration patterns through dialogue simulation
- Reveal power through organic feature combinations

### Discovery Through Use
**Learn by doing with guidance:**
- Suggest trying workflows with safe examples
- Guide through actual use cases rather than theoretical explanation
- Provide gentle correction and enhancement during use
- Build understanding through successful completion cycles

### Context-Sensitive Help
**Help that emerges when needed:**
- Detect confusion and offer clarification
- Provide just-in-time guidance during workflow execution
- Suggest alternatives when user seems stuck
- Offer deeper exploration when user shows interest

## Anti-Documentation Patterns

### No Manual Reading Required
**System usability without documentation dependency:**
- New users can start immediately through conversation
- Functionality discovery happens through natural interaction
- Advanced features revealed progressively through use
- System evolution doesn't break user mental models

### Organic Feature Discovery
**Features emerge through conversation:**
- Capabilities revealed when contextually relevant
- User discovers power through natural exploration
- System suggests enhancements when user ready
- Advanced workflows proposed when foundation solid

## Success Criteria

### Natural Usability Indicators
- New users productive within first conversation
- Feature discovery feels organic rather than overwhelming
- User finds desired functionality through natural questions
- System feels intuitive rather than documented

### Conversation Quality Metrics
- Questions lead to relevant capability discovery
- User feels guided rather than lost
- Suggestions match user intent and sophistication
- Discovery conversations feel helpful rather than mechanical

## Integration with System Evolution

### Discovery Evolution
**Discovery mechanisms evolve with system:**
- New capabilities automatically integrated into discovery flow
- User patterns inform discovery improvement
- Conversation quality improves through usage learning
- Discovery adapts to user base sophistication evolution

### Usage Pattern Learning
**System learns from discovery conversations:**
- Identify common discovery paths and optimize them
- Detect confusion points and improve guidance
- Learn user mental models and adapt accordingly
- Evolve suggestions based on successful discovery patterns
