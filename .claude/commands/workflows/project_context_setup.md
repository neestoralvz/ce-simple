# /workflows:project_context_setup - Vision-Ready Project Preparation

**30/07/2025 08:25 CDMX** | Prepare projects for vision-driven development

## Command Purpose
Set up project context and environment based on discovered vision, ensuring everything needed for implementation is ready before building begins.

**LOAD:** VISION.md + project_context/ + workflow_execution/project_setup/

## Core Philosophy
**"Complete context before implementation - esa es la magia"**

## Project Context Discovery Protocol

### Vision-to-Context Translation
**Convert discovered vision into project requirements:**
- Extract technical implications from vision principles
- Identify domain knowledge needed for implementation
- Determine user ecosystem constraints and opportunities
- Map vision goals to measurable project outcomes

### Context Completeness Assessment
**Ensure all necessary context is available:**
- **Domain understanding** - deep knowledge of problem space
- **User ecosystem** - environment, constraints, existing tools
- **Technical requirements** - what needs to be built and how
- **Success criteria** - how to know vision is fulfilled

### Gap Identification and Resolution
**Find and fill missing context:**
- Ask targeted questions based on vision analysis
- Research domain-specific requirements
- Investigate user environment and constraints
- Validate assumptions through user dialogue

## Setup Execution Framework

### Environment Preparation
**Based on discovered project needs:**
- Set up development environment aligned with vision
- Configure tools and workflows that serve project goals
- Establish quality gates that ensure vision alignment
- Create project structure that supports vision fulfillment

### Context Documentation
**Capture essential project context:**
- Document domain knowledge and constraints
- Record user ecosystem details and requirements
- Define success criteria and validation methods
- Create reference materials for implementation phase

### Implementation Readiness Validation
**Ensure readiness before moving to implementation:**
- All vision requirements translated to project context
- Complete understanding of user environment and needs
- Clear success criteria and validation methods available
- Development environment ready and aligned with vision

#### Built-in Safety Protocol
**Pre-setup validation:**
- "¿La estructura del proyecto refleja tu visión actual?"
- "¿El context discovered captura todo lo necesario para implementación?"
- "¿Te sientes ready para pasar a building con este foundation?"

**Post-setup confirmation:**
- "¿El setup del proyecto se siente correcto para tu visión?"
- "¿Hay algo en el context o environment que necesitas ajustar?"
- "¿El proyecto está ready para implementation o falta algo?"

## Vision Integration Protocol

### Vision-Driven Requirements
**Extract implementation requirements from vision:**
- Technical architecture needs based on vision principles
- User experience requirements from vision goals
- Quality and performance criteria from vision standards
- Integration needs with user ecosystem

### Context Evolution Capability
**Prepare for vision evolution during project:**
- Flexible project structure that adapts to vision changes
- Context update protocols when vision evolves
- Implementation adaptation methods for vision shifts
- Continuous alignment validation throughout project

## Multi-Modal Context Discovery

### Organic Investigation Techniques
**Adapt investigation approach to project needs:**
- Technical research for domain understanding
- User interviews for ecosystem comprehension
- Prototype exploration for requirement validation
- Competitive analysis for market context

### Bidirectional Context Expansion
**System asks expanding questions based on vision:**
- "¿Qué constraints del user ecosystem debemos considerar?"
- "¿Qué domain knowledge es crítico para success?"
- "¿Cómo sabremos que la vision está fulfilled?"
- "¿Qué dependencies externas podrían afectar implementation?"

## Success Criteria

### Context Completeness Indicators
- All vision requirements have clear implementation paths
- User ecosystem fully understood and documented
- Domain knowledge sufficient for confident implementation
- Success criteria clear and measurable

### Implementation Readiness Validation
- Development environment aligned with vision needs
- All necessary context available and accessible
- Clear project structure supporting vision fulfillment
- Quality gates established for vision alignment validation

## Usage Pattern
```
/workflows:project_context_setup [project description]
→ Analyze vision implications for project
→ Identify context gaps and requirements
→ Conduct organic context discovery
→ Set up environment and documentation
→ Validate implementation readiness
→ Ready for /workflows:implementation
```

## Integration Points
- **Input:** Discovered vision + project description
- **Process:** Context discovery + environment setup + readiness validation
- **Output:** Complete context + ready environment + clear success criteria
- **Next:** Implementation workflows with full context support

## Anti-Pattern Prevention
- **Premature implementation** without complete context
- **Generic setup** that doesn't reflect vision specifics
- **Static context** that doesn't evolve with vision
- **Assumption-based preparation** without user validation

**Authority**: VISION.md-driven context discovery + organic investigation
**Integration**: → vision_discovery, project_context/, workflow_execution/
**Evolution**: Setup methods evolve based on vision discoveries
