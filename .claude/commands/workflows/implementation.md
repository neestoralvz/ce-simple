# /workflows:implementation - Vision-Driven Building

**30/07/2025 08:30 CDMX** | Build things after vision is complete and context is ready

## Command Purpose
Execute actual implementation after vision discovery is complete and project context is fully prepared. Focus on building rather than discovering.

**LOAD:** VISION.md + workflow_execution/implementation_flows/ + complete project context

## Core Philosophy
**"Implementation becomes effortless when vision is complete and context is comprehensive"**

## Pre-Implementation Validation

### Vision Completeness Check
**Ensure vision discovery is truly complete:**
- User vision crystallized through conversation
- All expansion questions answered
- Context gaps filled and documented
- Success criteria clear and measurable

### Context Readiness Verification
**Confirm all necessary context is available:**
- Domain knowledge sufficient for confident building
- User ecosystem fully understood
- Technical requirements clear and validated
- Environment prepared and aligned with vision

### Implementation Strategy Definition
**Based on complete vision and context:**
- Break down vision goals into buildable components
- Define implementation sequence aligned with vision priorities
- Establish quality gates that ensure vision alignment
- Plan validation methods for each implementation phase

#### Built-in Safety Protocol
**Pre-implementation validation:**
- "¿La strategy de implementación refleja tu visión completamente?"
- "¿Los componentes identificados son los correctos para tu objetivo?"
- "¿Prefieres proceder con esta approach o ajustar algo antes de construir?"

**During major build phases:**
- "¿La implementación actual se siente alineada con tu visión?"
- "¿Los cambios que vemos van en la dirección correcta?"
- "¿Necesitas pausar para ajustar approach o continuamos?"

## Vision-Aligned Implementation Protocol

### Continuous Vision Alignment
**Throughout implementation:**
- Regular validation against VISION.md principles
- User feedback integration to ensure vision fulfillment
- Adjustment capability when implementation reveals vision refinements
- Quality assurance focused on vision delivery rather than technical perfection

### Incremental Value Delivery
**Build in vision-aligned increments:**
- Each increment delivers measurable vision value
- User validation at each increment
- Vision evolution capability during implementation
- Continuous refinement based on user feedback

### Context-Informed Decisions
**Use complete context for implementation choices:**
- Technical decisions based on user ecosystem constraints
- Architecture choices that serve vision principles
- User experience design aligned with discovered needs
- Integration approaches that respect user environment

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Vision Fulfillment Validation
**Continuous validation that implementation serves vision:**
- Regular check-ins with user on vision alignment
- Measurement against success criteria defined in context setup
- Adjustment protocols when implementation drifts from vision
- User satisfaction validation throughout process

### Technical Quality Gates
**Technical standards that serve vision delivery:**
- Code quality standards appropriate for vision requirements
- Performance criteria based on user ecosystem needs
- Security measures aligned with vision principles
- Maintainability standards that support vision evolution

## Implementation Adaptation Protocol

### Vision Evolution Integration
**When vision evolves during implementation:**
- Assess impact of vision changes on current implementation
- Adapt implementation plan to serve evolved vision
- Preserve completed work that still serves evolved vision
- Pivot implementation approach when vision fundamentally shifts

### User Feedback Integration
**Continuous user input throughout implementation:**
- Regular demonstration and feedback sessions
- Implementation adjustment based on user insights
- Vision refinement based on implementation learnings
- Iterative improvement based on actual usage patterns

## Success Criteria

### Vision Fulfillment Indicators
- User confirms implementation serves discovered vision
- Success criteria from context setup phase are met
- Implementation feels aligned with user's natural workflow
- Vision principles are clearly manifested in final result

### Implementation Quality Standards
- Technical implementation is robust and maintainable
- User experience is intuitive and efficient
- Integration with user ecosystem is seamless
- Performance meets or exceeds vision requirements

## Usage Pattern
```
/workflows:implementation [project with complete vision and context]
→ Validate vision completeness and context readiness
→ Define implementation strategy based on vision
→ Execute vision-aligned incremental building
→ Continuous validation and adjustment
→ Deliver implementation that fulfills discovered vision
```

## Integration Points
- **Input:** Complete vision + prepared context + ready environment
- **Process:** Vision-aligned building + continuous validation + user feedback integration
- **Output:** Implementation that fulfills discovered vision
- **Next:** Vision evolution for next project cycle

## Anti-Pattern Prevention
- **Implementation without complete vision** - force vision discovery first
- **Generic building** that doesn't reflect vision specifics
- **Technical perfection** over vision fulfillment priority
- **Static implementation** that can't adapt to vision evolution

**Authority**: VISION.md fulfillment + complete context utilization
**Integration**: → vision_discovery, project_context_setup, workflow_execution/
**Evolution**: Implementation approaches evolve with vision evolution
