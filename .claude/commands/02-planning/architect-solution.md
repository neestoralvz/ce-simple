# architect-solution

## Purpose

Executes comprehensive solution architecture through systematic design analysis providing structured implementation blueprint with cross-domain integration and scalability optimization.

## Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Focus on architectural design without implementation execution
- **Granular Approach**: Break architecture into modular components with clear interfaces
- **Resource Management**: Handle design complexity with explicit scalability requirements
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in validation protocols and design iteration capabilities

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
Mark "Requirements Analysis and Scope Definition" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute requirements gathering:
- Analyze discovery findings extracting functional and non-functional requirements
- Define system boundaries and integration points with existing infrastructure
- Establish quality attributes including performance and scalability criteria
- Validate scope completeness ensuring comprehensive requirement coverage

Use Read to analyze requirements:
- Discovery synthesis achieving requirement extraction
- Scope validation with boundary definition

If requirements gaps occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve requirements gap: stakeholder clarification"
- Execute targeted questioning with specific requirement validation
- Validate completeness ensuring comprehensive scope coverage
- Continue with validated requirements matrix

Complete previous phase, mark "Component Design and Interface Definition" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 2: Component Design
Mark "Component Design and Interface Definition" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute architectural decomposition:
- Decompose solution into modular components with clear responsibilities
- Define component interfaces and data contracts ensuring loose coupling
- Establish communication patterns and dependency relationships
- Design error handling and resilience patterns across components

Use Grep to analyze patterns:
- Pattern analysis achieving component identification
- Interface definition with dependency mapping

If design conflicts occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve design conflict: architectural trade-off analysis"
- Execute trade-off evaluation with stakeholder input validation
- Validate design coherence ensuring architectural consistency
- Continue with resolved architectural decisions

Complete previous phase, mark "Integration Architecture and Data Flow Design" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 3: Integration Architecture
Mark "Integration Architecture and Data Flow Design" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute integration planning:
- Design integration patterns and communication protocols between components
- Define data flow architecture with transformation and validation points
- Establish security boundaries and access control mechanisms
- Plan deployment architecture with environment and scaling considerations

Use Write to document architecture:
- Integration design achieving communication protocol definition
- Data flow documentation with security boundary specification

If integration complexity issues occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve integration complexity: simplification iteration"
- Execute design simplification with complexity reduction validation
- Validate integration feasibility ensuring implementation viability
- Continue with optimized integration architecture

Complete previous phase, mark "Validation and Documentation Generation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 4: Validation and Documentation
Mark "Validation and Documentation Generation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute architecture validation:
- Validate architecture against requirements ensuring complete coverage
- Generate comprehensive documentation with diagrams and specifications
- Create implementation guidance with phase breakdown and dependencies
- Establish validation criteria and success metrics for execution phases

Use Write to generate documentation:
- Architecture documentation achieving specification completeness
- Implementation guidance with validation criteria definition

If validation failures occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve validation failure: architectural revision"
- Execute targeted architecture revision with requirement realignment
- Validate revision completeness ensuring requirement satisfaction
- Complete architecture with validated design specifications

Complete all tasks using TodoWrite
