# plan-phases

## Purpose

Executes multi-phase implementation planning through systematic phase decomposition providing structured execution roadmap with dependency management and milestone validation.

## Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Focus on phase planning without execution management
- **Granular Approach**: Break implementation into sequential phases with clear dependencies
- **Resource Management**: Handle complexity allocation with explicit timeline requirements
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in phase adjustment protocols and dependency resolution

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Implementation Scope Analysis
Mark "Implementation Scope Analysis and Complexity Assessment" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute scope evaluation:
- Analyze solution architecture extracting implementation complexity factors
- Assess resource requirements and timeline constraints for planning
- Identify critical path dependencies requiring sequential execution
- Establish phase boundaries with clear completion criteria

Use Read to analyze scope:
- Architecture analysis achieving complexity extraction
- Resource assessment with timeline evaluation

If scope analysis failures occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve scope error: architectural clarification"
- Execute targeted architectural analysis with stakeholder input
- Validate scope completeness ensuring planning capability
- Continue with validated implementation parameters

Complete previous phase, mark "Phase Decomposition and Dependency Mapping" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 2: Phase Decomposition
Mark "Phase Decomposition and Dependency Mapping" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute phase design:
- Decompose implementation into logical phases with clear outcomes
- Map inter-phase dependencies establishing execution sequence
- Define phase deliverables and validation criteria for completion
- Establish resource allocation and team coordination requirements

Use Write to document phases:
- Phase decomposition achieving logical structuring
- Dependency mapping with sequence validation

If dependency conflicts occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve dependency conflict: sequence optimization"
- Execute phase reordering with dependency resolution analysis
- Validate sequence feasibility ensuring execution viability
- Continue with optimized phase structure

Complete previous phase, mark "Timeline Planning and Resource Allocation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 3: Timeline Planning
Mark "Timeline Planning and Resource Allocation" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute timeline development:
- Create realistic timeline estimates based on complexity assessment
- Allocate resources across phases balancing workload distribution
- Identify potential bottlenecks and capacity constraints
- Design contingency buffers for risk mitigation and schedule protection

Use Write to plan timeline:
- Timeline development achieving realistic estimation
- Resource allocation with bottleneck identification

If timeline conflicts occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve timeline conflict: capacity adjustment"
- Execute capacity rebalancing with realistic constraint validation
- Validate timeline feasibility ensuring delivery capability
- Continue with adjusted timeline parameters

Complete previous phase, mark "Milestone Definition and Validation Framework" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 4: Milestone Definition
Mark "Milestone Definition and Validation Framework" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute milestone planning:
- Define clear milestones and deliverables for each phase
- Establish validation criteria and success metrics for tracking
- Create review checkpoints with stakeholder approval gates
- Generate comprehensive implementation roadmap with tracking mechanisms

Use Write to define milestones:
- Milestone definition achieving phase tracking
- Validation framework with success metrics

If milestone validation issues occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve milestone issue: criteria refinement"
- Execute validation criteria refinement with stakeholder alignment
- Validate milestone clarity ensuring tracking capability
- Complete planning with validated implementation roadmap

Complete all tasks using TodoWrite
