# risk-assess

## Purpose

Executes comprehensive risk analysis through systematic threat identification providing structured mitigation strategies with impact assessment and contingency planning.

## Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Focus on risk assessment without mitigation implementation
- **Granular Approach**: Break risk analysis into threat categories with clear evaluation
- **Resource Management**: Handle assessment complexity with explicit prioritization requirements
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in evaluation protocols and assessment refinement capabilities

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Risk Identification and Categorization
Mark "Risk Identification and Threat Categorization" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute threat assessment:
- Identify technical risks from architecture and implementation complexity
- Assess business risks including timeline and resource constraints
- Evaluate operational risks affecting deployment and maintenance
- Categorize security risks and compliance requirements

Use Read to identify risks:
- Risk identification achieving threat discovery
- Categorization with complexity assessment

If identification gaps occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve identification gap: systematic review"
- Execute comprehensive systematic review with expert consultation
- Validate identification completeness ensuring coverage
- Continue with validated risk inventory

Complete previous phase, mark "Impact Analysis and Probability Assessment" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 2: Impact Analysis
Mark "Impact Analysis and Probability Assessment" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute impact evaluation:
- Assess potential impact magnitude for each identified risk
- Calculate probability estimates using historical data and analysis
- Evaluate cascading effects and interdependent risk relationships
- Quantify risk exposure with severity and likelihood matrices

Use Write to analyze impact:
- Impact evaluation achieving magnitude assessment
- Probability calculation with cascading analysis

If probability assessment issues occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve assessment issue: expert validation"
- Execute expert validation with conservative estimation protocols
- Validate probability accuracy ensuring assessment reliability
- Continue with validated impact parameters

Complete previous phase, mark "Mitigation Strategy Development and Planning" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 3: Mitigation Strategy Development
Mark "Mitigation Strategy Development and Planning" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute strategy formulation:
- Develop specific mitigation strategies for high-priority risks
- Design prevention measures and early detection mechanisms
- Create response protocols and recovery procedures
- Establish monitoring frameworks and escalation triggers

Use Write to develop strategies:
- Strategy formulation achieving mitigation planning
- Prevention design with detection mechanisms

If strategy conflicts occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve strategy conflict: resource optimization"
- Execute resource optimization with strategy prioritization
- Validate strategy feasibility ensuring implementation viability
- Continue with optimized mitigation approaches

Complete previous phase, mark "Contingency Planning and Monitoring Framework" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 4: Contingency Planning
Mark "Contingency Planning and Monitoring Framework" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute contingency development:
- Create detailed contingency plans for critical failure scenarios
- Establish risk monitoring and alerting systems
- Define decision criteria and escalation procedures
- Generate comprehensive risk management documentation

Use Write to plan contingencies:
- Contingency development achieving scenario planning
- Monitoring framework with alerting systems

If contingency validation issues occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve contingency issue: scenario testing"
- Execute scenario testing with validation protocols
- Validate contingency effectiveness ensuring preparedness
- Complete assessment with validated risk management framework

Complete all tasks using TodoWrite
