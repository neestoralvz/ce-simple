# User Feedback Orchestrator

**Command**: `/start-feedback-system`  
**Purpose**: Parallel enhancement of User Feedback System with 8 specialized sub-agents  
**Authority**: planning/projects/user-input-validation-ultra/  
**Context**: User feedback collection, categorization, and action protocols

## Overview

Deploy 8 parallel sub-agents to enhance the User Feedback System, focusing on comprehensive feedback mechanisms, advanced categorization (logros, desafios, errores, obstaculos, aprendizajes), context preservation, and feedback-to-action automation protocols.

## Sub-Agent Deployment Prompts
