# Planning Focus Templates Module

## Current Focus Display Template
```
üéØ Current Focus: Layer [X] - [Layer Description]

üìã Layer Scope:
  ‚Ä¢ [Scope item 1]
  ‚Ä¢ [Scope item 2]  
  ‚Ä¢ [Scope item 3]

‚úÖ Completed in this layer:
  ‚Ä¢ [Completed item 1]
  ‚Ä¢ [Completed item 2]

‚è≥ Current work:
  ‚Ä¢ [Active item 1] - [Status/progress]
  ‚Ä¢ [Active item 2] - [Status/progress]

üéØ Next priorities:
  ‚Ä¢ [Priority item 1]
  ‚Ä¢ [Priority item 2]
```

## Focus Change Validation Template
### Forward Movement (Higher Layer)
**Gate requirement:** Must pass /planning:gate validation first
**Block advancement:** If gate criteria not met, explain requirements
**Auto-gate:** Option to run gate validation automatically

### Backward Movement (Lower Layer)  
**Warning:** Confirm intention to return to previous layer
**Context:** Explain potential reasons (fixing foundation, addressing debt)
**Tracking:** Record focus change for project history

### Cross-Layer Change Detection Template
```
üîç Cross-Layer Change Detected:

Current Focus: Layer [Y] - [Description]
Proposed Change: [Change description]
Affects Layer: [X] - [Impact description]

Options:
1. Continue (isolated change, minimal impact)
2. Defer (significant dependencies, handle later)  
3. Change focus to Layer [X] (if appropriate)
4. Cancel (reconsider approach)

Your choice: [1-4]
```

## Layer-Specific Focus Areas Template
### Ce-Simple Focus Areas
**Layer 1 (Completed):** Context maturation, authority establishment
**Layer 2 (Current):** System crystallization, file size compliance, command optimization
**Layer 3 (Future):** Distribution readiness, export framework

### Web-App Focus Areas
**Layer 1:** Database schema, architecture decisions, data modeling
**Layer 2:** API development, business logic, authentication system
**Layer 3:** Frontend components, user interface, state management
**Layer 4:** Testing, deployment, performance optimization

### CLI-Tool Focus Areas
**Layer 1:** Core business logic, data structures, algorithm design
**Layer 2:** Command interface, argument parsing, help system
**Layer 3:** Configuration management, environment handling, validation
**Layer 4:** Packaging, installation, documentation, distribution

**Usage**: Layer focus management with cross-layer change detection and validation
