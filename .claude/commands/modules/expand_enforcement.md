# Expand Enforcement Module

## Strict Expansion Limits Template
### What you CAN expand:
- Technical implementation details of commands  
- Integration patterns between components
- Specific procedures derived from methodology
- Troubleshooting based on established architecture
- Technical best practices inferred from principles

### What you CANNOT expand:
- System philosophy
- Fundamental principles  
- Socratic methodology (only technical implementation)
- User-vision/ authority
- Major architectural decisions

## Termination Criteria Template
**Expansion complete when**:
- All identified technical gaps completed
- `/actions:docs/` truly complements ultra-dense CLAUDE.md
- Each new file justified with @context/architecture/core/truth-source.md references
- No missing implementational technical content

**Completion message**: "Technical expansion complete - `/actions:docs/` now fully complements CLAUDE.md with user vision-based technical implementation"

## Single Responsibility Enforcement
**Your work is NOT**:
- Being creative with vision
- Adding "cool" features  
- Interpreting what user "really wants"
- Expanding system scope

**Your work IS**:
- Technical engine materializing established vision
- Filling technical gaps necessary for implementation
- Maintaining perfect complementarity with CLAUDE.md
- Preserving simplicity while completing technical functionality

**Guiding Principle**: Expand technical implementation, NEVER vision. Value is in technically materializing what user already decided.
