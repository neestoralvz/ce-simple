# Start - Discovery Workflow Master

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Initialize comprehensive discovery workflow with dynamic questioning, context generation, and automated orchestration of analysis agents.

## ðŸš€ Usage
Execute: `/start [optional: initial request]`

## ðŸ”§ Implementation

### Discovery Protocol
1. **REQUEST CAPTURE**: Receive user input and analyze complexity level
2. **DYNAMIC QUESTIONING**: Generate contextual questions to clarify objectives
3. **CONTEXT SUFFICIENCY**: Determine if conceptual understanding is complete
4. **EXPLORATION ORCHESTRATION**: Deploy parallel/sequential agent workflows
5. **PROGRESS TRACKING**: Maintain transparent workflow notifications

### Workflow Orchestration Framework

#### Phase 1: Discovery & Context Building
```
âŸ³ /start â†’ discovery questions â†’ context validation â†’ exploration trigger
```

**MANDATORY Questions (Dynamic Generation)**:
- Objective clarification: "What specific outcome do you need?"
- Scope definition: "What are the boundaries of this request?"
- Context requirements: "What conceptual information should I understand?"
- Priority assessment: "What elements are most critical?"

#### Phase 2: Exploration Deployment
**AUTOMATIC Determination**:
- **Parallel Execution**: Independent research, pattern search, codebase exploration
- **Sequential Execution**: Dependent analysis requiring previous results

**Agent Deployment Matrix**:
- `/explore-codebase` â†’ Internal knowledge discovery
- `/explore-web` â†’ External pattern research  
- `/think-layers` â†’ Progressive analysis with context consolidation
- `/capture-learnings` â†’ Parallel pattern detection and post-execution learning

#### Phase 3: Analysis & Planning
**Progressive Thinking Protocol**:
1. **Think**: Basic analysis of discovered information
2. **Think-Hard**: Deep pattern recognition and connection mapping
3. **Think-Harder**: Complex integration and solution architecture
4. **Ultra-Think**: Comprehensive planning with execution roadmap

### Cognitive Load Management
**CRITICAL**: Monitor agent capacity and distribute workload optimally
- **Threshold Detection**: Identify when agent reaches cognitive limits
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute tasks across multiple agent instances
- **Context Switching**: Minimize context loss during agent handoffs

### Intelligent Notification System
**Real-Time Progress with Decision Context**:
```
ðŸŽ¯ START: Discovery initiated [timestamp]
ðŸ“Š DISCOVERY: Questions generated â†’ User response required
ðŸ§  DECISION: [Brief decision reasoning]
ðŸ”§ EXPLORATION: Deploying [N] agents â†’ [strategy + rationale]
âš¡ ANALYSIS: Think-layers activated â†’ Level [N] ([why this depth])
ðŸ§  LEARNING: Pattern capture active â†’ Process learning in parallel
âœ“ COMPLETION: Plan generated â†’ Ready for execution
ðŸŽ¯ ASSESSMENT: Post-execution learning evaluation â†’ [interview decision]
```

**Decision Transparency Examples**:
```
ðŸ§  DECISION: Local exploration sufficient â†’ Request matches existing patterns
ðŸ§  DECISION: Web research needed â†’ External validation required for solution
ðŸ§  DECISION: Parallel agents optimal â†’ Independent domains identified
ðŸ§  DECISION: Sequential flow required â†’ Analysis dependencies detected
ðŸ§  DECISION: Level 3 analysis needed â†’ Complex integration patterns found
ðŸ§  DECISION: Sufficient at level 2 â†’ Clear execution path identified
```

**Agent Communication Protocol**:
- **Deploy**: Main agent â†’ Task agent with specific objectives
- **Execute**: Task agent performs assigned function
- **Return**: Task agent â†’ Main agent with results summary
- **Announce**: Main agent updates user with progress + brief rationale

### Auto-Activation Triggers
**IMMEDIATE Activation**:
- User provides initial request with `/start`
- Insufficient context detected in any command
- Complex multi-step request identified

**Quick Decision Matrix**:
- **Complexity â‰¤5**: Local exploration, sequential agents, level 1-2 analysis
- **Complexity 6-7**: Mixed exploration, context-dependent agents, level 2-3 analysis  
- **Complexity â‰¥8**: Full exploration, parallel agents, level 3-4 analysis

### Output Standards
**Context Generation**:
- Create `context/discoveries/[session-id].md` with findings
- Update `context/patterns/[discovered-pattern].md` with new patterns
- Consolidate `context/research/[topic].md` with web findings

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Anti-bias content creation
- Cross-reference integration
- â‰¤200 lines per generated file
- Maximum density optimization

## âš¡ Triggers

### Input Triggers
**Context**: Any complex user request requiring systematic analysis
**Previous**: Entry point for all workflows
**Keywords**: start, begin, analyze, explore, research, plan, discovery

### Output Triggers
**When**: Discovery complete â†’ `/think-layers` for analysis and automatic consolidation
**When**: Insufficient context â†’ Recursive `/start` with refined scope
**When**: Simple request â†’ Direct command execution
**Chain**: start â†’ explore â†’ think-layers â†’ {docs-agent + main-execution} â†’ capture-learnings

### Success Patterns
**Discovery Success**: >90% context clarity achieved â†’ Proceed to analysis
**Exploration Success**: Comprehensive patterns identified â†’ Generate actionable plan
**Analysis Success**: Clear execution roadmap created â†’ Initiate implementation

### Git Integration Protocol
**SESSION-COMPLETION Tracking**: Automatic commit generation on successful discovery workflow completion

**Commit Structure**:
```bash
git add . && git commit -m "start: [intent] | [complexity]([X]) | [X]min | [outcome]
