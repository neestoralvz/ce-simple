# Start - Discovery Workflow Master

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Initialize comprehensive discovery workflow with dynamic questioning, context generation, and automated orchestration of analysis agents.

## ðŸš€ Usage
Execute: `/start [optional: initial request]`

## ðŸ”§ Implementation

### Discovery Protocol
1. **REQUEST CAPTURE**: Receive user input and analyze complexity level
2. **DYNAMIC QUESTIONING**: Generate contextual questions to clarify objectives
3. **CONTEXT SUFFICIENCY**: Determine if conceptual understanding is complete
4. **EXPLORATION ORCHESTRATION**: Deploy parallel/sequential agent workflows
5. **PROGRESS TRACKING**: Maintain transparent workflow notifications

### Workflow Orchestration Framework

#### Phase 1: Discovery & Context Building
```
âŸ³ /start â†’ discovery questions â†’ context validation â†’ exploration trigger
```

**MANDATORY Questions (Dynamic Generation)**:
- Objective clarification: "What specific outcome do you need?"
- Scope definition: "What are the boundaries of this request?"
- Context requirements: "What conceptual information should I understand?"
- Priority assessment: "What elements are most critical?"

#### Phase 2: Exploration Deployment
**AUTOMATIC Determination**:
- **Parallel Execution**: Independent research, pattern search, codebase exploration
- **Sequential Execution**: Dependent analysis requiring previous results

**Agent Deployment Matrix**:
- `/explore-codebase` â†’ Internal knowledge discovery
- `/explore-web` â†’ External pattern research  
- `/think-layers` â†’ Progressive analysis with context consolidation
- `/capture-learnings` â†’ Parallel pattern detection and post-execution learning

#### Phase 3: Analysis & Planning
**Progressive Thinking Protocol**:
1. **Think**: Basic analysis of discovered information
2. **Think-Hard**: Deep pattern recognition and connection mapping
3. **Think-Harder**: Complex integration and solution architecture
4. **Ultra-Think**: Comprehensive planning with execution roadmap

### Cognitive Load Management
**CRITICAL**: Monitor agent capacity and distribute workload optimally
- **Threshold Detection**: Identify when agent reaches cognitive limits
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute tasks across multiple agent instances
- **Context Switching**: Minimize context loss during agent handoffs

### Intelligent Orchestration
**Real-Time Progress**: Discovery â†’ Dynamic questions â†’ Context validation â†’ Multi-agent deployment

**Decision Framework**: Transparent rationale for exploration strategy, agent coordination, and analysis depth selection

**Communication Protocol**: Deploy â†’ Execute â†’ Return â†’ Announce cycle with progress rationale

### Auto-Activation Framework
**IMMEDIATE Triggers**: Direct `/start` invocation, insufficient context detection, complex multi-step requests

**Complexity Matrix**: â‰¤5 (local+sequential+L1-2) â†’ 6-7 (mixed+context+L2-3) â†’ â‰¥8 (full+parallel+L3-4)

### Output Standards
**Context Generation**:
- Create `context/discoveries/[session-id].md` with findings
- Update `context/patterns/[discovered-pattern].md` with new patterns
- Consolidate `context/research/[topic].md` with web findings

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Anti-bias content creation
- Cross-reference integration
- â‰¤200 lines per generated file
- Maximum density optimization

## âš¡ Triggers

### Input Triggers
**Context**: Any complex user request requiring systematic analysis
**Previous**: Entry point for all workflows
**Keywords**: start, begin, analyze, explore, research, plan, discovery

### Output Triggers
**When**: Discovery complete â†’ `/think-layers` for analysis and automatic consolidation
**When**: Insufficient context â†’ Recursive `/start` with refined scope
**When**: Simple request â†’ Direct command execution
**Chain**: start â†’ explore â†’ think-layers â†’ {docs-agent + main-execution} â†’ capture-learnings

### Success Patterns
**Discovery Success**: >90% context clarity achieved â†’ Proceed to analysis
**Exploration Success**: Comprehensive patterns identified â†’ Generate actionable plan
**Analysis Success**: Clear execution roadmap created â†’ Initiate implementation

### Automatic Learning Capture Protocol
**POST-WORKFLOW ASSESSMENT**: After workflow completion, evaluate learning value using scoring framework

**Learning Value Detection**: Auto-scoring â‰¥4 points â†’ /capture-learnings execution
**Framework**: Session completion â†’ threshold assessment â†’ auto-execution â†’ system enhancement

### Git Integration Protocol
**SESSION-COMPLETION Tracking**: Automatic standardized commit generation on successful workflow completion
