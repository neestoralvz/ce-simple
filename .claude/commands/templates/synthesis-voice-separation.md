# Synthesis Document Template - Voice Preservation Separation

## MANDATORY VOICE SEPARATION PROTOCOL

**VOICE CONTAMINATION = SYSTEM VIOLATION** - User voice and system analysis must be completely separated.

### Template Structure:

```markdown
# Synthesis: [Topic Name]

## ðŸ‘¤ USER VOICE - FUENTE DE VERDAD ABSOLUTA (IMMUTABLE)

### Core Decisions (Crystallized)
> "[Exact user quote 1 - decision made]" - Source: [/narratives/raw/conversations/file.md:line-X]
> "[Exact user quote 2 - preference expressed]" - Source: [/narratives/synthesis/file.md:line-Y]
> "[Exact user quote 3 - requirement stated]" - Source: [/narratives/raw/conversations/file.md:line-Z]

### Immutable Context
- **When**: [Exact moment/situation when expressed]
- **Why**: [User's stated reasoning in their words]
- **Impact**: [User's stated expected outcome]

**CRYSTALLIZED STATUS**: These decisions cannot be modified, interpreted, or evolved by system.

## ðŸ“Š SYSTEM ANALYSIS (INTERPRETATION - SEPARATE FROM USER VOICE)

### Architectural Implications
- [System interpretation of how to implement user decisions]
- [Technical translation of user requirements]
- [Implementation strategy based on user voice]

### Pattern Recognition
- [System-identified patterns from user voice]
- [Cross-synthesis correlations discovered]
- [Technical dependencies detected]

### Implementation Roadmap
- [System-generated action items from user voice]
- [Priority ordering based on user statements]
- [Resource allocation for user requirements]

## ðŸ”— VOICE PRESERVATION AUDIT

### Scoring Matrix
- **Quote Accuracy**: [X/10] - Zero paraphrasing detected
- **Intent Fidelity**: [X/10] - User meaning preserved exactly  
- **Context Completeness**: [X/10] - Full situational context captured
- **Source Traceability**: [X/10] - Perfect links to originals maintained
- **Attribution Clarity**: [X/10] - Complete separation user/system content
- **Immutability Status**: [X/10] - Crystallized decisions protected

**TOTAL VOICE PRESERVATION SCORE: [X/60]**

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] All user quotes are exact (no interpretation mixing)
- [ ] Clear section separation maintained throughout
- [ ] Source attribution complete for every quote
- [ ] Crystallized decisions marked as immutable
- [ ] System analysis clearly labeled as interpretation
- [ ] No voice contamination detected

## Next Steps
- [User-stated next actions in their words]
- [System interpretation of implementation steps]
```

## Usage Guidelines

### DO - Voice Preservation
- Use exact quotation marks for all user statements
- Link every quote to specific source location  
- Mark crystallized decisions as immutable
- Separate user voice from system analysis completely
- Preserve emotional tone and context of original expression

### DON'T - Voice Contamination
- Never paraphrase or interpret user words in user voice section
- Never mix user voice with system analysis in same section
- Never modify or evolve crystallized user decisions
- Never add implied meaning to user statements
- Never lose source traceability for quotes

## Integration with Workflow

### /create-doc Integration
- Voice Preservation Specialist automatically deployed
- Template applied with separation protocols enforced
- Voice scoring integrated into creation process

### /verify-doc Integration  
- Voice preservation validation required before approval
- Scoring must meet 90%+ threshold for document acceptance
- Automated detection of voice contamination patterns

### Quality Gates
- Voice separation compliance mandatory
- Source attribution completeness required
- Immutability marking enforced for crystallized decisions
- Clear attribution between user voice and system analysis

**ENFORCEMENT**: Documents not meeting voice preservation standards will be automatically rejected and returned for correction.
