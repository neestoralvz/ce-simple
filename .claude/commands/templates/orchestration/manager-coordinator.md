# Manager-Coordinator Orchestration - Pattern Template

## Pattern Definition (2025 Framework Standard)
**Pattern**: Central Coordination with Specialized Task Distribution
**Approach**: Manager-worker pattern with intelligent task routing and coordination
**Use Case**: Complex projects requiring central oversight, resource allocation, and strategic coordination

## Orchestration Framework
This template implements manager-coordinator patterns inspired by 2025 enterprise orchestration practices, combining centralized decision-making with distributed specialist execution.

## Pattern Structure

### Coordination Hierarchy
```
Manager-Coordinator: [Central Intelligence]
├── Planning Phase: Strategic analysis and task decomposition
├── Resource Allocation: Specialist assignment and coordination
├── Execution Oversight: Progress monitoring and adaptation
├── Quality Management: Standards enforcement and validation
└── Result Integration: Final consolidation and delivery
```

### Manager-Worker Pattern
```
Central Manager: [Coordination Specialist]
    ↓ (task distribution and oversight)
├── Worker A: [Specialist Type] → [Assigned Task] → [Progress Reports]
├── Worker B: [Specialist Type] → [Assigned Task] → [Progress Reports]
├── Worker C: [Specialist Type] → [Assigned Task] → [Progress Reports]
└── Worker D: [Specialist Type] → [Assigned Task] → [Progress Reports]
