# Peer-to-Peer Handoff Orchestration - Pattern Template

## Pattern Definition (2025 Framework Standard)
**Pattern**: Agent-to-Agent Task Delegation with Intelligent Routing
**Approach**: Distributed decision-making with peer-level task handoffs
**Use Case**: Dynamic workflows where task routing decisions are made by individual specialists based on expertise and capacity

## Orchestration Framework
This template implements peer-to-peer handoff patterns inspired by 2025 distributed systems practices, enabling autonomous specialist coordination without central management overhead.

## Pattern Structure

### Peer Network Topology
```
Peer Network: [Network Name]
├── Specialist A ↔ Specialist B (bidirectional handoff capability)
├── Specialist B ↔ Specialist C (expertise-based routing)
├── Specialist C ↔ Specialist D (capacity-based delegation)
└── Specialist D ↔ Specialist A (workflow completion routing)
```

### Peer Handoff Protocol
```
Current Specialist: [Current Agent]
    ↓ (decision: task analysis and routing evaluation)
Decision Logic: IF (task_type == expertise_area AND capacity_available)
    ↓ (action: continue with current specialist)
ELSE IF (other_specialist_better_suited)
    ↓ (action: handoff to optimal specialist)
Target Specialist: [Next Agent] + [Handoff Context]
    ↓ (execution: specialist processes task with context)
Result: [Task Output] + [Next Routing Decision]
```

## Implementation Template

### Dynamic Research Investigation (Example)
```
Peer Network: Adaptive Research Investigation
Initial Specialist: Research Specialist (Domain Agnostic)
Routing Criteria: Expertise match, workload balance, quality optimization
Success Criteria: Optimal specialist utilization with comprehensive results

Initial Task Entry:
Task: Research Specialist
Description: "Investigate [TOPIC] with optimal specialist routing"
Subagent: general-purpose
Prompt: "[Research Specialist template]
Peer Handoff Capability: Analyze task requirements and determine optimal specialist routing
Routing Logic:
- IF (purely technical research) → Consider handoff to Integration Specialist
- IF (performance-focused research) → Consider handoff to Performance Optimizer  
- IF (security-related research) → Consider handoff to Security Auditor
- IF (user experience research) → Consider handoff to Context Analyst
- IF (general domain research) → Continue with Research Specialist

Handoff Decision Framework:
1. Analyze task complexity and specialist expertise requirements
2. Evaluate current workload and capacity across peer network
3. Consider handoff benefits vs coordination overhead
4. Make routing decision with detailed justification

If Handoff Required:
- Prepare comprehensive context package for target specialist
- Include research progress, specific requirements, quality criteria
- Specify continuation strategy and expected deliverables"

Peer Routing Example 1: Technical Focus Detected
Current: Research Specialist
Decision: "Task requires deep technical integration analysis - handoff to Integration Specialist"
Handoff Context: {
    "research_progress": "Initial domain investigation complete",
    "focus_shift": "Technical integration patterns and compatibility analysis",
    "context_data": "[Current research findings]",
    "quality_requirements": "Technical accuracy with implementation feasibility",
    "expected_deliverable": "Integration-focused research with technical recommendations"
}

Target Specialist Continuation:
Task: Integration Specialist
Description: "Continue research with integration focus"
Input Context: [Handoff context from Research Specialist]
Subagent: general-purpose
Prompt: "[Integration Specialist template]
Continuation Context: Received handoff from Research Specialist
Task Evolution: Technical integration analysis with implementation focus
Peer Network Consideration: May need to handoff to Performance Optimizer if performance issues discovered"

Peer Routing Example 2: Performance Concerns Identified
Current: Integration Specialist  
Decision: "Integration analysis reveals performance bottlenecks - handoff to Performance Optimizer"
Handoff Context: {
    "integration_analysis": "Compatibility confirmed with performance concerns identified",
    "performance_focus": "Bottleneck analysis and optimization strategy development",
    "technical_context": "[Integration findings and performance indicators]",
    "optimization_scope": "Performance improvement without compromising integration",
    "final_synthesis": "Integration + Performance unified recommendations"
}

Final Specialist Processing:
Task: Performance Optimizer
Description: "Complete investigation with performance optimization"
Input Context: [Combined context from Research + Integration specialists]
Final Deliverable: Comprehensive investigation with research, integration, and performance insights
```

### Adaptive Quality Assurance (Example)
```
Peer Network: Multi-Dimensional Quality Validation
Initial Specialist: Quality Assurance (General)
Routing Criteria: Quality issue type, specialist expertise, validation depth required
Success Criteria: Comprehensive quality validation with specialist expertise application

Quality Assessment Entry:
Task: Quality Assurance
Description: "Assess quality with adaptive specialist routing"
Subagent: general-purpose
Prompt: "[Quality Assurance template]
Peer Network Integration: Analyze quality requirements and route to appropriate specialists
Quality Routing Logic:
- IF (architecture concerns detected) → Handoff to Architecture Validator
- IF (security issues identified) → Handoff to Security Auditor
- IF (performance problems found) → Handoff to Performance Optimizer
- IF (integration issues discovered) → Handoff to Integration Specialist
- IF (general quality issues) → Continue with Quality Assurance

Handoff Decision Process:
1. Perform initial quality assessment across all dimensions
2. Identify quality issues requiring specialist expertise
3. Prioritize issues by severity and specialist availability
4. Route to most appropriate specialist with comprehensive context"

Example Routing Chain:
Initial QA → Architecture Issues → Architecture Validator
Architecture Validator → Security Concerns → Security Auditor  
Security Auditor → Performance Impact → Performance Optimizer
Performance Optimizer → Final Validation → Quality Assurance (Consolidation)

Multi-Hop Context Preservation:
Each handoff maintains cumulative context:
{
    "quality_history": "[All previous quality assessments]",
    "specialist_findings": "[Findings from each specialist in chain]",
    "cumulative_improvements": "[All improvements made during routing]",
    "final_validation_requirements": "[What needs final QA validation]"
}
```

## Peer-to-Peer Decision Making

### Routing Intelligence
```
Specialist Decision Framework:
def evaluate_handoff_decision(current_task, specialist_capabilities, peer_network):
    # Expertise Matching
    expertise_match = calculate_expertise_alignment(task_requirements, current_specialist)
    peer_expertise = evaluate_peer_expertise(task_requirements, available_peers)
    
    # Capacity Assessment  
    current_capacity = assess_current_workload(current_specialist)
    peer_capacity = assess_peer_availability(available_peers)
    
    # Quality Optimization
    quality_potential = estimate_quality_outcome(current_specialist, task)
    peer_quality_potential = estimate_peer_quality(available_peers, task)
    
    # Handoff Decision
    if (peer_expertise > expertise_match + expertise_threshold AND 
        peer_capacity > capacity_threshold AND
        peer_quality_potential > quality_potential + quality_threshold):
        return select_optimal_peer(available_peers, selection_criteria)
    else:
        return continue_with_current_specialist()
```

### Context Handoff Protocol

    },
    "specialist_chain": [
        {
            "specialist_type": "[Previous specialist]",
            "contribution": "[What they contributed]",
            "handoff_reason": "[Why handoff occurred]"
        }
    ],
    "quality_requirements": "[Quality criteria and standards]",
    "context_data": "[All relevant data and findings]",
    "routing_constraints": "[Any limitations on further routing]",
    "expected_deliverable": "[Final expected output]"
