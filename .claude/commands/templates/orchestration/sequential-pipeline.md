# Sequential Pipeline Orchestration - Pattern Template

## Pattern Definition (2025 Framework Standard)
**Pattern**: Linear Agent Chaining with Dependent Task Execution
**Approach**: CrewAI-style sequential workflow with clear handoff protocols
**Use Case**: Complex tasks requiring step-by-step processing where each phase depends on previous results

## Orchestration Framework
This template implements sequential pipeline patterns inspired by 2025 multi-agent best practices, combining CrewAI role-based architecture with LangGraph stateful workflow principles.

## Pattern Structure

### Phase Definition Template
```
Pipeline: [Pipeline Name]
Phases: [X] sequential phases
Dependencies: Linear (Phase N depends on Phase N-1)
Error Handling: Gate-based with rollback capabilities
```

### Sequential Execution Pattern
```
Phase 1: [Specialist Type] → [Objective] → [Output Format]
    ↓ (handoff: [specific data/context passed])
Phase 2: [Specialist Type] → [Objective] → [Output Format]  
    ↓ (handoff: [accumulated context + new results])
Phase 3: [Specialist Type] → [Objective] → [Output Format]
    ↓ (handoff: [final consolidated results])
Final: [Integration/Validation Phase]
```

## Pipeline Management Patterns

### State Management Between Phases
```
Pipeline State Structure:
{
    "pipeline_id": "[unique_identifier]",
    "current_phase": "[phase_number]",
    "phase_results": {
        "phase_1": { "output": "[results]", "metadata": "[context]" },
        "phase_2": { "output": "[results]", "metadata": "[context]" },
        ...
    },
    "accumulated_context": "[growing_context_through_pipeline]",
    "error_state": "[none/recovery/failed]",
    "quality_gates": {
        "phase_1_validation": "[pass/fail]",
        "phase_2_validation": "[pass/fail]",
        ...
    }
}
```

### Error Handling and Recovery
```
Error Detection:
IF (phase_output != expected_format OR quality_gate == FAIL) {
    LOG_ERROR(phase_number, error_type, context)
    TRIGGER_RECOVERY(phase_number, error_state)
}

Recovery Strategies:
- **Retry with Context**: Re-execute phase with additional context
- **Alternative Specialist**: Deploy different specialist for problematic phase  
- **Rollback and Restart**: Return to previous successful phase
- **Manual Intervention**: Escalate to human oversight for complex issues
```

### Quality Gates Between Phases
```
Quality Gate Template:
Phase N Completion Criteria:
□ Output format matches expected structure
□ Required information completeness validated
□ No critical errors in specialist output
□ Context handoff data properly formatted
□ Integration requirements met for next phase
□ Quality threshold achieved (score >= minimum)

Gate Validation:
IF (all_criteria == PASS) {
    PROCEED_TO_NEXT_PHASE(accumulated_context + current_results)
} ELSE {
    TRIGGER_ERROR_RECOVERY(failed_criteria, retry_strategy)
}
```
