# Explore Web - External Pattern Research

## 🎯 Purpose
Conduct systematic web research for patterns, solutions, and best practices using parallel search operations.

## 🚀 Usage
Execute: `/explore-web [search-topic] [research-depth]`

## 🔧 Implementation

### Behavioral Reinforcement Protocol
**MANDATORY at research initialization**:

```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {"content": "🌐 SCOPE: Determine research depth and topic complexity", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "web-scope-1"},
  {"content": "⚡ PARALLEL: Deploy optimal search count (4-16 operations)", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "web-parallel-1"},
  {"content": "🔍 VALIDATION: Cross-reference findings across sources", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "web-validate-1"},
  {"content": "🎯 SYNTHESIS: Consolidate research into actionable intelligence", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "web-synthesize-1"},
  {"content": "📝 CONTEXT: Generate research documentation with anti-bias protocols", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "web-context-1"}
])
```

**Intelligence-Driven Research**: Add dynamic todos based on topic complexity and discovery quality during research

### Dynamic Parallelization Protocol
**PHASE 1**: Analyze topic complexity and research depth
**PHASE 2**: Determine optimal search count (4-16 operations)
**PHASE 3**: Deploy optimized parallel searches in single message

### Research Protocol Framework
**Analyze Before Execute**: Optimize parallelization via complexity assessment
**Dynamic Scaling**: 4 searches (simple) → 16 searches (complex)
**Pattern Extraction**: Systematic identification of successful patterns
**Anti-Bias**: Cross-reference across multiple independent sources

### Parallelization Intelligence
**Simple** (4 searches): Implementation patterns, use cases, tools/frameworks, best practices
**Moderate** (8 searches): Add performance, security, integration, troubleshooting
**Complex** (16 searches): Add enterprise patterns, advanced architectures, scaling, expert insights

### Parallel Search Orchestration
**MAX PARALLELIZATION**: 16 simultaneous WebSearch operations

**Core (4)**: Implementation patterns, case studies, tech stacks, problem solutions
**Context (4)**: Adjacent tech, performance, security, migration
**Tools (4)**: Framework comparisons, CI/CD, monitoring, community
**Advanced (4)**: Trends, expert insights, enterprise scale, success metrics

### Research Quality Framework
**Source Diversity**: Multiple independent sources for validation
**Evidence-Based**: All recommendations backed by verifiable examples
**Bias Detection**: Identify commercial, trend, confirmation, and recency bias
**Pattern Recognition**: Extract architectural, implementation, process, and tool patterns

### Context Integration System
**Cross-Reference**: Compare findings across all parallel searches
**Prioritization**: Rank solutions by viability and practical fit
**Synthesis**: Consolidate research into actionable intelligence
**File Organization**: Structured output to `context/research/` directory

### Efficiency Optimization
**90% Speed Improvement**: 16 searches in 90 seconds vs 16+ minutes sequential
**Comprehensive Coverage**: Multi-angle analysis with cross-validation
**Smart Adaptation**: Dynamic query refinement
**Quality Assurance**: Authority verification and consensus validation

## ⚡ Triggers

### Input Triggers
**Context**: External research and pattern validation required following discovery
**Previous**: `/start` research phase or `/explore-codebase` external validation
**Keywords**: research, patterns, solutions, best practices, examples

### Output Triggers
**Success**: Research complete → `/think-layers` for synthesis and analysis
**Validation**: Multiple sources confirm approach → Ready for implementation
**Integration**: Comprehensive patterns identified → Action plan generation
**Chain**: explore-web → think-layers → execution workflow

### Success Patterns
**Research Success**: >90% solution coverage → Analysis pipeline triggered
**Pattern Success**: Clear implementation patterns → Action plan generation
**Validation Success**: Multi-source confirmation → Implementation readiness
