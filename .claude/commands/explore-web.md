# Explore Web - External Pattern Research

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Conduct systematic web research for patterns, solutions, best practices, and implementation examples using parallel search operations for comprehensive coverage.

## ðŸš€ Usage
Execute: `/explore-web [search-topic] [research-depth]`

## ðŸ”§ Implementation

### Research Protocol
**MANDATORY**: Deploy multiple WebSearch tasks for comprehensive coverage
**Parallel Research**: Execute 4 simultaneous searches for maximum efficiency
**Pattern Extraction**: Systematic identification of successful implementation patterns
**Anti-Bias Validation**: Cross-reference findings across multiple independent sources

### Parallel Search Orchestration
**Search 1**: Implementation patterns and best practices analysis
**Search 2**: Real-world case studies and practical applications
**Search 3**: Technology stack analysis and tool comparisons
**Search 4**: Common problems and proven solutions mapping

### Research Quality Framework
**Source Diversity**: Multiple independent sources for validation
**Evidence-Based**: All recommendations backed by verifiable examples
**Bias Detection**: Identify commercial, trend, confirmation, and recency bias
**Pattern Recognition**: Extract architectural, implementation, process, and tool patterns

### Context Integration System
**Cross-Reference**: Compare findings across all parallel searches
**Prioritization**: Rank solutions by viability and practical fit
**Synthesis**: Consolidate research into actionable intelligence
**File Organization**: Structured output to `context/research/` directory

### Efficiency Optimization
**70-80% Speed Reduction**: Through parallel search deployment
**Comprehensive Coverage**: Multi-angle analysis with cross-validation
**Smart Query Adaptation**: Dynamic refinement based on initial results
**Quality Assurance**: Authority verification and consensus validation

## âš¡ Triggers

### Input Triggers
**Context**: External research and pattern validation required following discovery
**Previous**: `/start` research phase or `/explore-codebase` external validation
**Keywords**: research, patterns, solutions, best practices, examples

### Output Triggers
**Success**: Research complete â†’ `/think-layers` for synthesis and analysis
**Validation**: Multiple sources confirm approach â†’ Ready for implementation
**Integration**: Comprehensive patterns identified â†’ Action plan generation
**Chain**: explore-web â†’ think-layers â†’ execution workflow

### Success Patterns
**Research Success**: >90% solution coverage â†’ Analysis pipeline triggered
**Pattern Success**: Clear implementation patterns â†’ Action plan generation
**Validation Success**: Multi-source confirmation â†’ Implementation readiness
