## Purpose

Executes progressive cognitive analysis through structured layer escalation with parallel Task Tool orchestration, providing comprehensive breakthrough discovery with simultaneous multi-agent processing and strategic understanding optimization.

## Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Focus on progressive cognitive analysis with parallel Task Tool orchestration
