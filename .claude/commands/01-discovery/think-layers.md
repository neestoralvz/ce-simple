# think-layers

## Purpose

Executes progressive cognitive analysis through structured layer escalation providing comprehensive breakthrough discovery with systematic insight synthesis and strategic understanding.

## Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Focus on progressive cognitive analysis without implementation activities
- **Granular Approach**: Break complex problems into sequential layers with clear validation
- **Resource Management**: Handle analytical progression with explicit depth requirements
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in fallback mechanisms and layer-specific recovery protocols

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Cognitive Depth Assessment
Mark "Cognitive Depth Assessment and Layer Planning" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute problem evaluation:
- Evaluate problem complexity determining required thinking depth
- Design cognitive progression pathway with validation gates
- Establish breakthrough criteria for meta-analytical thinking discovery
- Configure adaptive assessment protocols for depth optimization

Use Read to evaluate complexity:
- Problem evaluation achieving scope understanding
- Depth assessment with progression pathway

If assessment failures occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve assessment error: conservative progression"
- Execute conservative depth progression with intermediate defaults
- Validate progression readiness ensuring analytical capability
- Continue with validated depth parameters

Complete previous phase, mark "Layer 1 Foundation Analysis and Pattern Recognition" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 2: Foundation Analysis
Mark "Layer 1 Foundation Analysis and Pattern Recognition" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute pattern recognition:
- Perform foundational pattern recognition and structural understanding
- Identify core problem elements and primary relationship patterns
- Document basic insights with evidence validation assessment
- Establish analytical foundation for progressive escalation

Use Read to recognize patterns:
- Pattern recognition achieving structural understanding
- Problem analysis with evidence validation

If resource constraints occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve constraint: fallback protocols"
- Execute fallback protocols maintaining analysis quality
- Validate analysis completeness ensuring foundation capability
- Continue with validated basic understanding

Complete previous phase, mark "Progressive Layer Execution and Insight Synthesis" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 3: Progressive Layer Execution
Mark "Progressive Layer Execution and Insight Synthesis" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute depth layers:
- Progress through relationship analysis and strategic synthesis
- Apply meta-analytical thinking for breakthrough discovery
- Consolidate insights across executed layers with resolution
- Validate analytical progression ensuring enhanced understanding

Use Write to synthesize insights:
- Layer execution achieving depth progression
- Insight synthesis with contradiction resolution

If analytical conflicts occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve conflict: weighted evidence analysis"
- Execute weighted evidence analysis resolving layer conflicts
- Validate conflict resolution ensuring analytical integrity
- Continue with validated progressive understanding

Complete previous phase, mark "Breakthrough Documentation and Strategic Guidance" as in_progress using TodoWrite

### Phase 4: Breakthrough Documentation
Mark "Breakthrough Documentation and Strategic Guidance" as in_progress using TodoWrite

Execute comprehensive synthesis:
- Synthesize breakthrough insights from executed cognitive layers
- Document strategic recommendations with implementation guidance
- Generate comprehensive analysis report with insight development
- Create actionable strategic guidance supporting decision making

Use Write to document breakthroughs:
- Breakthrough synthesis achieving comprehensive intelligence
- Strategic documentation with implementation guidance

If synthesis gaps occur:
- Add TodoWrite task: "Resolve synthesis gap: analytical refinement"
- Execute continuous analytical refinement with discovered insights
- Validate synthesis completeness ensuring strategic capability
- Complete analysis with validated breakthrough understanding
