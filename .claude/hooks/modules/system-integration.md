# System Integration - Coordination Authority

**31/07/2025 CDMX** | Complete system coordination and integration

## AUTORIDAD SUPREMA
hooks/README.md → system-integration.md implements complete integration authority per hooks system

## PRINCIPIO FUNDAMENTAL
**"Seamless coordination with complementary protection layers"** - Integration framework enabling system harmony without duplication.

## INTEGRATION FRAMEWORK

### **Git Hooks Coordination**
- Claude Code Hooks provide **development-time** protection
- Git Hooks provide **repository-level** protection  
- Both systems complement without duplication

### **fswatch System Coordination**
- fswatch provides **24/7 monitoring** (if installed)
- Claude Code Hooks provide **workflow-integrated** protection
- Both systems can coexist with different scopes

### **Project Standards Integration**
- Enforces ADR-004 (file size violations)
- Supports ADR-005 (reference architecture)
- Validates ADR-006 (enforcement vocabulary)
- Maintains structural standards compliance

## COORDINATION BENEFITS

### **Layered Protection Strategy**
Multi-layer protection system provides comprehensive coverage through specialized protection layers operating in harmony.

### **Scope Differentiation**
Clear scope separation prevents system conflicts while maximizing protection coverage across all development phases.
