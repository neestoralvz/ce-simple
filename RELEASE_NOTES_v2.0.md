## ✨ NEW SYSTEM CAPABILITIES

### 🤖 Multi-Subagent Intelligence Dispatcher
- **Orchestration Engine**: Main agent NEVER executes direct work
- **Specialized Deployment**: Task-specific subagent deployment via Task tools
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent subagent execution for maximum efficiency
- **Voice Preservation**: Exact user intent capture with zero interpretation bias

### 📋 Document Workflow Enforcement
```
MANDATORY WORKFLOW (NO EXCEPTIONS):
1. `/create-doc` - Content Specialist deployment
2. `/align-doc` - Architecture Validator deployment  
3. `/verify-doc` - Quality Assurance deployment
```
- **Active Blocking**: Pre-execution validation prevents direct .md file creation
- **Violation Logging**: Automatic tracking in `/data/workflow-violations/`
- **Auto-Redirection**: Seamless workflow guidance with user voice preservation

### 🔄 Session Continuity System
- **`/start`**: Git status + handoff loading + project maintenance + insights extraction
- **`/session-close`**: Conversation capture + command updates + git commit + handoff generation
- **Handoff Architecture**: Complete context preservation between sessions
- **Git Intelligence**: Automatic correlation between conversations and commits

### 🎯 Anti-Bias Enforcement
- **Agnostic Writing**: NO descriptive adjectives, NO linguistic bias
- **Neutral Communication**: Facts-only presentation without interpretation
- **User Voice Priority**: Original decisions preserved exactly as stated
- **Think X4 Methodology**: Think → Think Hard → Think Harder → Super Think
